The black arrow on the right represents the dependency between layers, and each layer can be stripped from the upper layer to be reused, the Service and Config layers are API, and the other layers are SPI.\nGreen boxes are extension interfaces, blue boxes are implementation classes, image only shows implementation class of associated layers.\nThe blue dashed line is the initialization process, which is assembly chain when starting, red line for the method call process, which is calling chain when running, purple triangle arrow is inherited, can treat subclass as the same node of parent class, text of lines are the method invocation.\n\nLayer description\n\nconfig layer: external config interface, ServiceConfig and ReferenceConfig is the center of the layer, you can directly initialize config class, also can generate config class by spring.\nproxy layer: transparent proxy of service interface, generate client Stub of service and server Skeletion of service, ServiceProxy is the center, extension interface is ProxyFactory.\nregistry layer: encapsulation of service registry and discovery, service URL is the center, extension interfaces are RegistryFactory, Registry and RegistryService.\ncluster layer: encapsulation of cluster of muliple providers and load balance, and bridging registration center, Invoker is the center, extension interfaces are Cluster, Directory, Router, LoadBalance.\nmonitor layer: monitor of RPC call times and call execute time, Statistics is the center, extension interface are MonitorFactory, Monitor, MonitorService\nprotocol layer: encapsulation of RPC, Invocation and Result are the center, extension interfaces are Protocol, Invoker, Exporter\nexchange layer: encapsulation of request and response, synchronous transfer asynchronous, Request and Response are the center, extension interfaces are Exchanger, ExchangeChannel, ExchangeClient, ExchangeServer\ntransport layer: abstraction of mina and netty, Message is the center, extension interfaces are Channel, Transporter, Client, Server, Codec\nserialize layer: reusable tools, extension interfaces are Serialization, ObjectInput, ObjectOutput, ThreadPool\n\nRelationship description\n\nIn RPC, Protocol is the core layer, it means that you can complete RPC calling by Protocol + Invoker + Exporter, then filter at the main process of Invoker.\nConsumer and Provider are abstraction concepts, just want you have a more intuitive understanding of which classes belong to the client and server side, the reason not use Client and Server is that Dubbo uses Provider, Consumer, Registry, Monitor divide logical topology node in many scenes, keep the concept of unity.\nCluster is external concept, the purpose of Cluster is that make various Invoker disguise to one Invoker, so that we just pay attention to the Invoker in Protocol layer, adding Cluster or removing Cluster will not affect other layers, because we don't need Cluster when only have one provider.\nThe Proxy layer encapsulates the transparent proxy for all interfaces, and in other layers with Invoker as the center, turn Invoker into interface, or turn interface implementation into Invoker by Proxy only when exposuring to user. RPC still work even removing Proxy layer, but not so transparent, making remote service calling don't look like local service calling.\nRemoting is the implemetation of Dubbo protocols, you can remove Remoting if choosing RMI. The Remoting is divided into Transport layer and Exchange layer, Transport layer is responsible for one-way message transmission, it's abstraction of Mina, Netty, Grizzly, it also can extend UDP transmission. The Exchange layer encapsulates the Request-Response semantics over the transport layer.\nActually Registry and Monitor are not at the same layer, they are independent nodes, draw them together by layer just for global view.\n\nModules packaging\n\nModules description:\n\ndubbo-common module: includes Util classes and common modules.\ndubbo-remoting module: is Dubbo protocol implementation, no need to use this module if using RMI for RPC.\ndubbo-rpc module: abstraction of various protocols, and dynamic proxy, only one to one call, not concerned with the management of cluster.\ndubbo-cluster module: disguise many service providers as one provider, including load balancing, fault tolerance, routing, etc. the address list of clusters can be either static or send by registry.\ndubbo-registry module: Based on the cluster of registry send address and the abstraction of various registry centers.\ndubbo-monitor module: statistics of service call times, call time, call chain tracked services.\ndubbo-config module: is Dubbo external API, users use Dubbo by Config, hide Dubbo details.\ndubbo-container module: is a Standlone container, just use Main method to load Spring, because usually service no need Tomcat/JBoss features.\n\nPackage dividing according to the layer structure, and the difference with layer dividing:\n\ncontainer is service container, for service running deployment, not showed in the image.\nprotocol layer and proxy layer are placed in RPC module, they are the core of RPC module, you can use these 2 layers complete RPC call when only have 1 provider.\ntransport layer and exchange layer are placed in remoting module, for RPC call base comminucation.\nserialize layer is placed in common module, for reuse.\n\nDependence relationship\n\nImage description:\n\nThe boxes in image, Protocol, Cluster, Proxy, Service, Container, Registry, Monitor represent layer or module, the blues mean interactive with business, the greens mean only internal interactive with Dubbo.\nThe backgroud boxes in image, Consumer, Provider, Registry, Monitor represent deployment logical topology node.\nThe blue dashed line in the image is called for initialization, the red dashed line is called asynchronously for runtime, and the red line is called synchronously for runtime.\nThe image only includes RPC layer, don't includes Remoting layer, the whole Remoting hides in Protocol layer.\n\nCall chain\nExpand the red call chain of the overall design map:\n\nExpose service sequence\nExpand the initialization chain of service provider exposes service which at the left of the overall design map, the sequence diagram shows below:\n\nReference service sequence\nExpand the initialization chain of service consumer references service which at the right of the overall design map, the sequence diagram shows below:\n\nDomain model\nThe core domain models of Dubbo:\n\nProtocol is service domain, it is the main function entrance of Invoker exposure and reference, it is responsible for the life cycle management of Invoker.\nInvoker is entity domain, it is the core model of Dubbo, all the other models are disturbed, or converted to it, it represents an executable, you can call it by calling invoke, it can be a local implementation, a remote implementation, or a cluster implementation.\nInvocation is session domain, it holds variables in the calling process, such as the method name, the parameters, and so on.\n\nBase design principle\n\nUse Microkernel + Plugin design pattern，Microkernel only responsible for assembly Plugin, the functions of Dubbo are implemented by extension points, it means that all functions of Dubbo can be replaced by self defined extension by user.\nUse URL to be the startdard format of config information, all extension points transfer config information by URL.\n\nMore design principles refer to: Framework design principle\n"},"SPI.html":{"url":"SPI.html","title":"3 How SPI Works","keywords":"","body":"SPI Loading\nSPI Config\nSource：\nDubbo SPI is inherited from standard JDK SPI(Service Provider Interface) and makes it more powerful.\nDubbo fixed below issues of the standard JDK SPI：\n\nthe standard JDK  SPI will load  and instantize all implementation at once. It will be a waste of resources if the implementation is timecosted ,but never be used.\nWe cann't accquire the SPI name,if loading the SPI implementation is failed.For example：standard JDK  ScriptEngine，get script type by invoking method getName(). RubyScriptEngine class will load failed if the depenency jar jruby.jar is missing，and the real error info will be lost. When user executes ruby scripts , program throws exception , telling not support ruby, but it is not the real cause.\nEnhance the SPI functionality by supporting  IoC and AOP ，one SPI can be easily injected by another SPI simply using  setter.\n\nAppointment：\nIn the jar file containing extension class 1，places a config file  META-INF/dubbo/full interface name，file content pattern：SPI name=the fully qualified name for the extension class，use new line seperator for multiple implementation.\nExample：\nTo extend  Dubbo Protocol，placee a text file in the extension jar file：META-INF/dubbo/com.alibaba.dubbo.rpc.Protocol，content：\nxxx=com.alibaba.xxx.XxxProtocol\n\ncontent of the implementation 2：\npackage com.alibaba.xxx;\n\nimport com.alibaba.dubbo.rpc.Protocol;\n\npublic class XxxProtocol implemenets Protocol { \n    // ...\n}\n\nConfiguration in config module\nIn Dubbo config module，all SPI points have related attributes or labels，we can choose the specific SPI implementation by using its name. Like：\n\n\nSPI Features\nSPI Auto Wrap\nAuto wrap the SPI's Wrapper class。ExtensionLoader  loads the SPI implementation，if the SPI has a copy instructor ,it will be regarded as the SPI's Wrapper class。\nWrapper class content：\npackage com.alibaba.xxx;\n\nimport com.alibaba.dubbo.rpc.Protocol;\n\npublic class XxxProtocolWrapper implemenets Protocol {\n    Protocol impl;\n\n    public XxxProtocol(Protocol protocol) { impl = protocol; }\n\n    //after interface method is executed，the method in extension will be executed\n    public void refer() {\n        //... some operation\n        impl.refer();\n        // ... some operation\n    }\n\n    // ...\n}\n\nWrapper class also implements the same SPI interface，but Wrapper is not the real implementation。It is used for wrap the real  implementation  returned from the ExtensionLoader 。The real returned instance by   ExtensionLoader  is the Wrapper class instance，Wrapper holder the real SPI implementation class。\nThere can be many Wrapper for one spi, simply add one if you need。\nBy Wrapper class,you will be able move same logics into Wrapper for all SPIs。Newly added Wrapper class add external logics for all spis, looks like  AOP， Wrapper acts as a proxy for SPI.\nSPI Auto Load\nwhen loading the SPI，Dubbo will auto load the depency SPI. When one SPI implementation contains attribute which is also an SPI of another type,ExtensionLoader will automatically load the depency SPI.ExtensionLoader knows all the members of the specific SPI by scanning the setter method of all implementation class.\nDemo：two SPI  CarMaker（car maker）、WheelMaker (wheel maker)\nIntefaces look like：\npublic interface CarMaker {\n    Car makeCar();\n}\n\npublic interface WheelMaker {\n    Wheel makeWheel();\n}\n\nCarMaker  implementation：\npublic class RaceCarMaker implemenets CarMaker {\n    WheelMaker wheelMaker;\n\n    public setWheelMaker(WheelMaker wheelMaker) {\n        this.wheelMaker = wheelMaker;\n    }\n\n    public Car makeCar() {\n        // ...\n        Wheel wheel = wheelMaker.makeWheel();\n        // ...\n        return new RaceCar(wheel, ...);\n    }\n}\n\nwhenExtensionLoader loading CarMaker  implementation RaceCar ，setWheelMaker  needs paramType WheelMaker  which is also an SPI, It will be automatically loaded .\nThis brings a new question:How ExtensionLoader determines which implementation to use when load the injected SPI。As for this demo, when existing multi WheelMaker  implementation, which one should the ExtensionLoader  chooses.\nGood question ,we will explain it in the following chapter: SPI Auto Adaptive.\nSPI Auto Adaptive\nThe depency SPI that ExtensionLoader  injects is an instance of Adaptive，the real spi implementation is known until the adaptive instance is be executed.\nDubbo  use URL (containing Key-Value) to pass the configuration.\nThe SPI method invocation has the URL parameter（Or Entity that has URL attribute）\nIn this way depended SPI can get configuration from URL，after config all SPI  key needed, configuration information will be passed from outer by URL.URL act as a bus when pass the config information.\nDemo：two SPI  CarMaker、WheelMaker\ninterface looks like：\npublic interface CarMaker {\n    Car makeCar(URL url);\n}\n\npublic interface WheelMaker {\n    Wheel makeWheel(URL url);\n}\n\nCarMaker  implementation：\npublic class RaceCarMaker implemenets CarMaker {\n    WheelMaker wheelMaker;\n\n    public setWheelMaker(WheelMaker wheelMaker) {\n        this.wheelMaker = wheelMaker;\n    }\n\n    public Car makeCar(URL url) {\n        // ...\n        Wheel wheel = wheelMaker.makeWheel(url);\n        // ...\n        return new RaceCar(wheel, ...);\n    }\n}\n\nwhen execute the code above\n// ...\nWheel wheel = wheelMaker.makeWheel(url);\n// ...\n\n，the injected Adaptive  object determine which  WheelMaker 's  makeWheel  method will be executed by predefined Key.。Such  as wheel.type, key  url.get(\"wheel.type\")  will determine WheelMake  implementation。The logic ofAdaptive instance of fixed，getting the predefined Key of the URL，dynamically creating the real implementation and execute it.\nFor Dubbo , the SPI  Adaptive  implementation in  ExtensionLoader  is dynamically created when dubbo is loading the SPI。Get the Key from URL, the Key will be provided through @Adaptive annotation for the interface method definition.\nBelow is Dubbo  Transporter SPI codes：\npublic interface Transporter {\n    @Adaptive({\"server\", \"transport\"})\n    Server bind(URL url, ChannelHandler handler) throws RemotingException;\n\n    @Adaptive({\"client\", \"transport\"})\n    Client connect(URL url, ChannelHandler handler) throws RemotingException;\n}\n\nfor the method bind(),Adaptive will firstly search server key，if no Key  were founded then will search transport key ，to determine the implementation that the proxy represent for.\nSPI Auto Activation\nAs for Collections SPI, such as：Filter, InvokerListener, ExportListener, TelnetHandler, StatusChecker  etc，multi implementations can be loaded at one time. User can simplify configuration by using auto activation，Like：\nimport com.alibaba.dubbo.common.extension.Activate;\nimport com.alibaba.dubbo.rpc.Filter;\n\n@Activate // Active for any condition\npublic class XxxFilter implements Filter {\n    // ...\n}\n\nOr：\nimport com.alibaba.dubbo.common.extension.Activate;\nimport com.alibaba.dubbo.rpc.Filter;\n\n@Activate(\"xxx\") // when configed xxx parameter and the parameter has a valid value,the SPI is activated，for example configed cache=\"lru\"，auto acitivate CacheFilter。\npublic class XxxFilter implements Filter {\n    // ...\n}\n\nOr：\nimport com.alibaba.dubbo.common.extension.Activate;\nimport com.alibaba.dubbo.rpc.Filter;\n\n@Activate(group = \"provider\", value = \"xxx\") // only activate for provider，group can be \"provider\" or \"consumer\"\npublic class XxxFilter implements Filter {\n    // ...\n}\n\n\n1. Note：The config file here is in you own jar file，not in dubbo release jar file，Dubbo  will scan all jar files for the same filename in  ClassPath and merge together then ↩\n\n\n2. Note：SPI will be loaded in singleton pattern（Please ensure thread safety ），cached in  ExtensionLoader  ↩\n\n"},"implementation.html":{"url":"implementation.html","title":"4 Init, Process, Protocols","keywords":"","body":"Implementation details\nInitialization details\nService parsing\nBased on META-INF/spring.handlers config in dubbo.jar, Spring calls DubboNamespaceHandler when meeting dubbo namespace.\nAll Dubbo tags are parsed by DubboBeanDefinitionParser, based on one to one attribute mapping, the XML label is parsed as a Bean object.\nTransfer Bean object to URL, and transfer all attributes of Bean to URL parameters when ServiceConfig.export() or ReferenceConfig.get() initialization.\nThen pase URL to Protocol extension point, based on Extension point adaptive mechanism of extension point, processing service exposure or reference for different protocols according to URL protocol header.\nService Exposure\n1.

Here we introduce the implementation of the two typical protocols, Dubbo and RMI:\nDubbo implementation\nThe transformation from Invoker of Dubbo protocol to Exporter takes place in the export method of DubboProtocol class, it mainly opens the socket to listen service and receive all kinds of requests sent by the client, and the communication details are implementated by Dubbo itself.\nRMI implementation\nThe transformation from Invoker of RMI protocol to Exporter takes place in the export method of RmiProtocol class, the RMI service is implementated by Spring, Dubbo or JDK, and the communication details are implementated by JDK, which saves a lot of work.\nThe detail process of serving service for service consumer\n\nThe above image is the main process of service consumption:\nFirst, the init method of ReferenceConfig class calls the refer method of Protocol to generate Invoker instance(such as the red part in the above image), which is the key of service consumption. Then the Invoker is converted to the interface required by the client (such as: HelloWorld).\nFor each protocol such as RMI/Dubbo/Web service, the details they call refer method generate Invoker instance are similar to the previous section.\nInvoker everywhere\nBecause of Invoker is a very important concept in the Dubbo domain model, many of the design ideas are close to it. This makes Invoker permeate the entire implementation code, and it's really easy to mix up for people who have just started Dubbo.\nLet's use a simple image below to describe the 2 important Invoker: service provider Invoker and service consumer Invoker:\n\nTo better explain the above image, we provide the below code examples of service consumption and providers:\nService consumer code:\npublic class DemoClientAction {\n\n    private DemoService demoService;\n\n    public void setDemoService(DemoService demoService) {\n        this.demoService = demoService;\n    }\n\n    public void start() {\n        String hello = demoService.sayHello(\"world\" + i);\n    }\n}\n\nThe DemoService in above code is the proxy of service consumer in above image, user can call Invoker 5 which implementate the real RPC by the proxy.\nService provider code:\npublic class DemoServiceImpl implements DemoService {\n\n    public String sayHello(String name) throws RemoteException {\n        return \"Hello \" + name;\n    }\n}\n\nThe above class would be encapsulated to be a AbstractProxyInvoker instance, and create a new Exporter instance, then find corresponding Exporter instance and call its corresponding AbstractProxyInvoker instance when network communication layer recieve request, so that real call service provider code. There are some other Invoker classes, but the above 2 are the most important.\nRemote communication details\nProtocol header agreement\n\nThread dispatch model\n\n\nDispather: all, direct, message, execution, connection\nThreadPool: fixed, cached\n\n\n1. is  or  ↩\n\n\n2. is  ↩\n\n\n3. is  ↩\n\n\n4. is  ↩\n\n\n5. is one of DubboInvoker, HessianRpcInvoker, InjvmInvoker, RmiInvoker, WebServiceInvoker ↩\n\n"},"impls/introduction.html":{"url":"impls/introduction.html","title":"5 SPI Extensions","keywords":"","body":"SPI Extension Implementations\nSPI extension interface is used for system integration, it's also useful for dubbo contributor to extend dubbo functionality.\n"},"impls/protocol.html":{"url":"impls/protocol.html","title":"5.1 Protocol","keywords":"","body":"Protocol Extension\nSummary\nExtension to RPC protocol, hide details of remote call.\nContract:\n\nWhen user calls invoke() method of Invoker object which's returned from refer() call, the protocol needs to correspondingly execute invoke() method of Invoker object passed from remote export() method associated with the same URL.\nMoreover, it's protocol's responsibility to implement Invoker which's returned from refer().

But adding new features will affect stability, dubbo uses the following version development pattern to achieve a good balance.\nTwo versions evolving at the same time\n\nBugFix Version：low version，e.g. 2.4.x. This is called the GA version, which can be applied in production. We are supposed only to fix bugs in this version, and increase the third version number when release.\nFeature Version：high version, e.g. 2.5.x. We add new features to this version, so applications have opportunities try new features.\n\nWhen features in 2.5.x are proved stable enough, we will announce 2.5.x as a beta release. \nWhen 2.5.x proved stable after enough test on enough applications：\n\n2.5.x, the GA Version, only do BugFix, the main version to be used. We can try to promote applications to upgrade to GA at the desired time.\n2.4.x, no longer maintained. When bugs appear, applications have no choice but upgrade to the latest stable version- Sunset Clause\nWe create a new branch 2.6.0 based on 2.5.x for new features.\n\nPros\n\nGA Version are promised stable:\nonly BugFix\nGA Version got enough tests before promotion\n\n\nNew features can respond quickly in Feature Version and allow applications to try that\nSignificantly reduces development and maintenance costs \n\nThe responsibilities of users\nUsers should always keep in track with the GA Version, make sure all bugs were fixed.\nThere is a fake proposition: regular upgrades bring more risks. Here's the reasons:\n\nGA remains stable after a trial period.\nBugs find on GA will be fixed immediately.\nComparing with the on-need-upgrade (only upgrade when find a serious problem, and may span multiple versions), upgrade periodically can flat risk. Experienced a long cycle of large projects, students will have such an experience, the tripartite library version does not upgrade for a long time, the result of the problem had to upgrade to the new version (across multiple versions) a huge risk.\n\n"},"contribution.html":{"url":"contribution.html","title":"10 Contribution","keywords":"","body":"\ntable {\n  width: 100%;\n  max-width: 65em;\n  border: 1px solid #dedede;\n  margin: 15px auto;\n  border-collapse: collapse;\n  empty-cells: show;\n}\ntable th,\ntable td {\n  height: 35px;\n  border: 1px solid #dedede;\n  padding: 0 10px;\n}\ntable th {\n  font-weight: bold;\n  text-align: center !important;\n  background: rgba(158,188,226,0.2);\n  white-space: nowrap;\n}\ntable tbody tr:nth-child(2n) {\n  background: rgba(158,188,226,0.12);\n}\ntable td:nth-child(1) {\n  white-space: nowrap;\n}\ntable tr:hover {\n  background: #efefef;\n}\n.table-area {\n  overflow: auto;\n}\n\n\n\n[].slice.call(document.querySelectorAll('table')).forEach(function(el){\n    var wrapper = document.createElement('div');\n    wrapper.className = 'table-area';\n    el.parentNode.insertBefore(wrapper, el);\n    el.parentNode.removeChild(el);\n    wrapper.appendChild(el);\n})\n\nContribution\nFlow\n\nDirect adding new project, black-box dependent on Dubbo for function extension.\nFork Dubbo on Github for BUG fixing or modify the framework.\nPull Request after changing.\n\nTasks\n\n\n\nFuncation\nType\nPriority\nStatus\nClaimer\nPlan complete time\nprogress\n\n\n\n\n Translation\nDocument\nHigh\nUnclaimed\nPending\nPending\n0%\n\n\n translation\nDocument\nHigh\nUnclaimed\nPending\nPending\n0%\n\n\nExtension point compatibility testing\nTesting\nHigh\nClaimed\n罗立树\nPending\n0%\n\n\nPerformance benchmark testing\nTesting\nHigh\nUnclaimed\nPending\nPending\n0%\n\n\nFunctional unit testing\nTesting\nHigh\nUnclaimed\nPending\nPending\n0%\n\n\nJTA/XA distributed transaction\nInterceptor extension\nHigh\nUnclaimed\nPending\nPending\n0%\n\n\nThrift\nProtocol extension\nHigh\nDeveloping done\n闾刚\n2012-04-27\n90%\n\n\nICE\nProtocol extension\nHigh\nUnclaimed\nPending\nPending\n0%\n\n\nACE\nProtocol extension\nLow\nUnclaimed\nPending\nPending\n0%\n\n\nJSON-RPC\nProtocol extension\nLow\nUnclaimed\nPending\nPending\n0%\n\n\nXML-RPC\nProtocol extension\nLow\nUnclaimed\nPending\nPending\n0%\n\n\nJSR181&CXF(WebService)\nProtocol extension\nHigh\nDeveloping done\n白文志\n2012-04-27\n90%\n\n\nJSR311&JSR339(RestfulWebService)\nProtocol extension\nHigh\nUnclaimed\nPending\nPending\n0%\n\n\nJMS&ActiveMQ\nProtocol extension\nHigh\nUnclaimed\nPending\nPending\n0%\n\n\nProtobuf\nSerialization extension\nHigh\nResearching\n朱启恒\n2012-02-30\n20%\n\n\nAvro\nSerialization extension\nLow\nUnclaimed\nPending\nPending\n0%\n\n\nXSocket\nTransmission extension\nLow\nUnclaimed\nPending\nPending\n0%\n\n\nCGLib\nDynamic proxy extension\nLow\nUnclaimed\nPending\nPending\n0%\n\n\nJNDI\nRegistry extension\nHigh\nUnclaimed\nPending\nPending\n0%\n\n\nLDAP\nRegistry extension\nLow\nUnclaimed\nPending\nPending\n0%\n\n\nJSR140&SLP\nRegistry extension\nHigh\nUnclaimed\nPending\nPending\n0%\n\n\nUDDI\nRegistry extension\nHigh\nUnclaimed\nPending\nPending\n0%\n\n\nJMX\nMonitoring expansion\nHigh\nUnclaimed\nPending\nPending\n0%\n\n\nSNMP\nMonitoring expansion\nHigh\nUnclaimed\nPending\nPending\n0%\n\n\nCacti\nMonitoring expansion\nHigh\nUnclaimed\nPending\nPending\n0%\n\n\nNagios\nMonitoring expansion\nHigh\nUnclaimed\nPending\nPending\n0%\n\n\nLogstash\nMonitoring expansion\nHigh\nUnclaimed\nPending\nPending\n0%\n\n\nJRobin\nMonitoring expansion\nHigh\nUnclaimed\nPending\nPending\n0%\n\n\nMaven\nPackage management\nLow\nUnclaimed\nPending\nPending\n0%\n\n\nSubversion\nPackage management\nLow\nUnclaimed\nPending\nPending\n0%\n\n\nJCR/JSR283\nPackage management\nLow\nUnclaimed\nPending\nPending\n0%\n\n\nSimpleDeployer\nLocal deployment agent\nLow\nUnclaimed\nPending\nPending\n0%\n\n\nSimpleScheduler\nScheduler\nLow\nUnclaimed\nPending\nPending\n0%\n\n\n\n"},"checklist.html":{"url":"checklist.html","title":"11 Checklist","keywords":"","body":"Checklist\nChecklist before release\n\ngithub milestones\ngithub change lists\nTravis CI\ntest code\nfind bugs\n\nChecklist for bigfix versions\n\nCreate a github issue before coding\nCreate unit test before bugfix\nReview\nTest your code (Normal process / Abnormal process)\nRecord your design on github issue\nComplete javadoc and comment in code\nManager for every version, responsible for scope and check\n\n"},"code-smell.html":{"url":"code-smell.html","title":"12 Code Smell","keywords":"","body":"Bad Smell\nUgly Dubbo design or implementation will be record here.\nURL Convertion\n1.

SPI Auto Adaptive\nWhen ExtensionLoader loads SPI, It will check spi attributes(using set method) . If one attribute is SPI, ExtensionLoader  will load the SPI implementation. Auto injected object is an adaptive instance（proxy） ,because the real implementation is confirmed only in execution stage.。when adaptive spi is invoked, Dubbo will choose the real implementation and executes it. Dubbo choose the right implementation according to the parameters that the mehod defines.\nAll the inner SPIs that  Dubbo defines have the URL  parameter defined for the method invocation. Adaptive SPI uses URL to determine which implementation is needed. One specific Key and Value in the URL confirms the usage of the specific implementation, All these is done by adding @Adaptive  annotation.\n@Extension\npublic interface Car {\n    @Adaptive({\"http://10.20.160.198/wiki/display/dubbo/car.type\", \"http://10.20.160.198/wiki/display/dubbo/transport.type\"})\n    public run(URL url, Type1 arg1, Type2 arg2);\n}\n\nFor the rules above，ExtensionLoader  will create a adaptive instance for each SPI injected.\nExtensionLoader generated adaptive classes  look like ：\npackage ;\n\npublic class $Adpative implements  {\n    public () {\n        if(parameters containing URL Type?) using URL parameter\n        else if(method returns URL) using the return URL\n        # \n\n        if(URL accquired == null) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"url == null\");\n        }\n\n        According to the Key order from @Adaptive annotation，get the Value from the URL as the real SPI name\n        if no value is found then use the default SPI implementation。If no SPI point， throw new IllegalStateException(\"Fail to get extension\");\n\n        Invoke the method using the spi and return the result.\n    }\n\n    public () {\n        throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"is not adaptive method!\");\n    }\n}\n\n@Adaptive  annotation usage：\nIf no value is configed for those Keys in URL，default SPI implementation is used。For example ，String[] {\"key1\", \"key2\"}，firstly Dubbo will look up value for key1 and use it as SPI name;if key1 value is not founded then look up for key2，if value of key2 is also not found ,then use default spi implementation. If no default implementation is configed, then the method will throw IllegalStateException。if not configed , then default implement is lower case of the interface class full package name. For Extension interface com.alibaba.dubbo.xxx.YyyInvokerWrapper , default value is new String[] {\"yyy.invoker.wrapper\"}\nCallback Function\n1. Parameter Callback\nmain theory ： in the persistent connection for one consumer->provider，export a service in  Consumer side，provider  side can reversely call the instance in consumer side.\nImplement details：\n\nFor exchanging interface instance in transmition, auto export and auto refer is implemented in DubboCodec . Need to seperate business logic and codec logic.\nyou will need to judge whether needing callback when getting exporter from invocation，if needed, get the callback instance id from the attachments. By using this method, consumer side can implement the callback interface with different implementations.\n\n2. Event Notification\nmain theory ： when Consumer  executing invoke method，judging if any configuration for  onreturn/onerror... put  the method for onreturn to the callback list of the async invocatioin.\nImplement details：parameters is passed using URL，but string-object is not supported for URL, so the method is stored in  staticMap，it needs to be optimized.\nLazy Connection\nDubboProtocol  specific features, default disabled\nWhen client creating proxy for server, do not establish TCP persistent connection at first, only init the connecton when data is needing transmision.\nThis feather will disable the connection retry policy , resend the data again(if connection is lost when sending data ,try to establish a new connection to send data)\nShare Connection\nDubboProtocol specific features, default enabled。\nJVM A export many services，JVM B  refer more than one services of A，Share Connection means those different services invocations between A and B uses the same TCP connection  to transmit data, reducing server connections.\nImplement details：when using share connection for the same address，you need pay more attention to the invoker's destroy action.on one hand, you should close the connection when all the invokers refering the same address is destroyed, on another hand ,you should not close the connection when not all of the invokers are destroyed. In design implementation, we uses a strategy called reference count , we create a connection called Lazy connection for exceptions not affacting business when closing the connection just in case.\nsticky policy\nwhen existing many providers and configing the sticky policy，invocation will be sent to the same provider as last invocation. Sticky Policy opens the lazy attribute of connection, for avoiding open useless connectons.\nprovider selecting logic\n\nexisting multi providers，firstly select by Loadbalance 。If the selected  provider is available ,then just doing the invocation\nIf the selected provider is not available in stage 1, then choose from the remaining ,if available then doing the inovation\nIf all providers are not available , rescan the list(not choosen invoker first),juding if any provider is available, if existing,doing the invocatiion.\nIf no available provider in stage 3, then the next invoker of the invoker of stage 1 will be choosen(if not the last one),avoiding collision.\n\n"},"TCK.html":{"url":"TCK.html","title":"13 TCK","keywords":"","body":"Compatibility test\nDubbo's protocol, communication, serialization, registry, load balancing and other SPI all offer alternative strategies for different application scenarios while our test cases are very scattered. Ours is always uncertain whether it can satisfy the complete contract of the extension point when users need to add a new implementation.     \nThus we need to use TCK (Technology Compatibility Kit) for the core extension points.  When users add a new implementaion, compatibility with the rest of the framework can be ensured with TCK. This can effectively improve the overall health and also facilitate the access of the third party extenders, which accelerates the maturity of the open source community.\nXingzhi from the open source community is already working on this part. His preliminary idea is to build a TCK framework for Dubbo drawing on the CDI-TCK of JBoss first, then realize the TCK implementing case of Dubbo. \nReference：http://docs.jboss.org/cdi/tck/reference/1.0.1-Final/html/introduction.html\nAnyone interested  is welcomed to work on this together. \nProtocol TCK\n\nTODO\n\nRegistry TCK\n\nTODO\n\n"}}}
