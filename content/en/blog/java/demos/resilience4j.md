Resilience4j provides a set of higher-order functions (decorators) including circuit breakers, rate limiters, retries, and isolation, which can enhance any functional interface, lambda expression, or method reference, and these decorators can be layered. The benefit of doing this is that you can choose specific decorators to combine as needed.

For usage examples of integrating Resilience4j with Dubbo, please refer to [dubbo-samples-resilience4j](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples/tree/master/3-extensions/protocol/dubbo-samples-resilience4j)
