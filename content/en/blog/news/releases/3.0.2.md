    Apache Dubbo 3.0.2 Release Announcement
---

## New Features
- Support for exposing generalized services via the @DubboService annotation
- XML configuration support for the metadata center with protocol and port attributes
- Compatibility with versions above curator5
- Point-to-point calls support wildcard matching, allowing one provider address to correspond to multiple interfaces
- Dynamic configuration added for application-level service discovery to override rules
- Provides a switch for dynamic configuration override rules for providers, allowing them to ignore dynamic configuration and not re-expose
- Supports native image
- Provides a switch to cancel the execution of the shutdown hook
- Supports service governance rules for Kubernetes Mesh
- Netty connection supports SSL configuration

## Bug Fixes
- DubboBootStrap start duplication causes dynamic configuration to be overridden
- Dynamic configuration rules remain effective after deletion
- NullPointerException thrown when exposing triple protocol
- ConfigCenterConfig.setAddress method overwrites the username attribute
- DefaultFuture.closeChannel destroys consumer-side thread pool
- TripleClientHandler.writeRequest throws NullPointerException
- NullPointerException thrown when parsing 3.0 migration rules exception
- Order issue with Activated Extensions
- URLAddress.parse method has issues parsing ipv6 addresses
- User-defined parameters in properties configuration are ineffective
- Configuration overlap issue when using API model and Spring model simultaneously
- Application-level service discovery ineffective at startup
- Nacos registry fails to dynamically detect changes in the number of providers
- ${dubbo.application} cannot be resolved by the Spring placeholder rules in XML files
- Issue obtaining the order of instance parameters, first obtaining instance-level parameters, then interface-level parameters
- Exception thrown when registering application startup listener if DubboConfigBeanInitializer does not exist
- Mock parameters containing ':' or '=' characters are ineffective
- NullPointerException when deleting Mesh rules

## Optimization
- Catch exceptions in RemovalTask to ensure semaphore can be released
- Check for duplicate ReferenceConfig/ServiceConfig using unique service names
- Optimize random number generation performance
- If users use interface-level service discovery, do not publish application-interface mapping data to the metadata center
- Use StringBuilder#append(Char) to improve performance
- Ensure the order of interfaces in GRPC compiled class files
- Optimize reference bean placeholder resolution
- Utilize CompletableFuture#get(long, TimeUnit) in MergeableClusterInvoker for performance improvement
- Built-in service MetadataService does not delay exposure
- Optimize the startup logic of ConfigBean and Bootstrap
- Optimize logic for checking duplicate Configs
- Use ring data structures for registration notifications
- Optimize initialization logic for dynamic configurations
- ConfigManager uses ConcurrentHashMap to remove locking logic, improving equals and toString performance
- Optimize MetadataInfo equals method and Instance Listener
- Optimize asynchronous export/refer logic
- Use TreeSet data structure to ensure the order of application names during application-level service discovery
- First ten notifications from RegistryNotifier are not delayed
- dubbo-compile compiles using a new format to generate stubs
- Mesh service governance rules unify grouping and other rule groupings in the dynamic configuration center, changing DEFAULT_GROUP to dubbo
- When using nacos as a registration center, parameters can be used in the registration center address to change the grouping in nacos
- When calculating ServiceInfo reversion, remove runtime parameters to avoid generating multiple revisions
- Nacos registry wraps exceptions as RpcException on throw
- Prevent dynamic configuration center from dynamically modifying some permission parameters
- Optimize initialization process of Config Bean and ensure compatibility with spring 3.x/4.1.x
- Bootstrap.start method is reentrant, exposing or referencing new services
- Add classes in the org.apache.dubbo package to the whitelist by default
- Ensure the uniqueness of generated Config Id and check for previous existence
- Javaassist compatible with changing override declaration fields
- Refactor check logic during decoding, throwing exceptions when providers corresponding to path and version are not found
- When ApplicationModel is null, compatible with adaptive extensions

## Code Quality Improvements

Thanks for the contributions that enhance the stability of Apache Dubbo.
