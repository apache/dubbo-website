If you are dealing with an issue, please remember to **label it with one or more tags that you find meaningful**. With labels, other developers can easily identify the issue for categorization and tracking progress.

For issues and pull requests that require coding and release fixes, you need to **label them as [milestone](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestones)**.

Some commonly used labels:

* Help Wanted
  * help wanted
  * good first issue
* Priority
  * priority/blocker
  * priority/high
  * priority/low
  * priority/normal
* Status
  * status/need-triage
  * status/DO-NOT-MERGE
  * status/READY-TO-MERGE
  * status/invalid
  * status/wontfix
* Type
  * type/bug
  * type/documentation
  * type/enhancement
  * type/feature
