Anyone can become a contributor to an Apache project. Being a contributor simply means you are interested in the project and contribute in some way, from asking reasonable questions (which document the project and provide feedback to the developers) to providing new features as patches.

If you become a valuable contributor to a project, you may be invited to become a Committer. A Committer is a term used by the ASF (Apache Software Foundation) to refer to individuals who commit to a specific project. It grants you write access to the project's repository and resources.

In the Dubbo community, if a Committer achieves a significant number of excellent contributions, they may be invited to join the Project Management Committee (PMC).

When you are unfamiliar with the open source development process used by ASF, it can sometimes be difficult to understand that we value community over code. A strong and healthy community will be respected and become an interesting and rewarding place. More importantly, a diverse and healthy community can support the code for a long time, even as individual companies come and go in the space.
