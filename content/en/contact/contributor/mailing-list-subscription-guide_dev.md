The Apache Incubator's Dubbo developer mailing list (dev@dubbo.apache.org) has been established. Please feel free to subscribe and refer to [^1] for more details.

Here is a brief guide on subscribing to the Dubbo mailing list:

1. Send an email to dev-subscribe@dubbo.apache.org, leaving the content and subject empty. You will receive an email with the following content:

to: hello@example.com

subject: confirm subscribe to dev@dubbo.apache.org
mailed-by: apache.org

Hi! This is the ezmlm program. I'm managing the
dev@dubbo.apache.org mailing list.

I'm working for my owner, who can be reached
at dev-owner@dubbo.apache.org.

To confirm that you would like

   hello@example.com

added to the dev mailing list, please send
a short reply to this address:

   dev-sc.xxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx-hello=example.com@dubbo.apache.org

Usually, this happens when you just hit the "reply" button.
If this does not work, simply copy the address and paste it into
the "To:" field of a new message.

or click here:
        mailto:dev-sc.xxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx-hello=example.com@dubbo.apache.org

...
```

2. Reply to the email, leaving the content and subject empty, and you will receive another email with the following content:

```

to: hello@example.com

Welcome to dev@dubbo.apache.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
