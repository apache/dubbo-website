Hi! This is the ezmlm program. I'm managing the
dev@dubbo.apache.org mailing list.

I'm working for my owner, who can be reached
at dev-owner@dubbo.apache.org.

To confirm that you would like

   hello@example.com

a short reply to this address:

If this does not work, simply copy the address and paste it into
the "To:" field of a new message.
