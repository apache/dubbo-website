### configuration: [^1]

configuration file location
```sh
dubbo-admin-server/src/main/resources/application.properties
```
configuration:
```properties
admin.config-center=zookeeper://127.0.0.1:2181
admin.registry.address=zookeeper://127.0.0.1:2181
admin.metadata-report.address=zookeeper://127.0.0.1:2181
```
the three configure item above are configuration center, registry center and metadata center respectively, you can find explanation about the three centers [here](../user/configuration/config-center.md)
Same as Dubbo 2.7, you can set the addresses of metadata center and registry center on configuration center, in zookeeper, the path and content are as below: 
```properties
# /dubbo/config/dubbo/dubbo.properties
dubbo.registry.address=zookeeper://127.0.0.1:2181
dubbo.metadata-report.address=zookeeper://127.0.0.1:2181
```
the addresses in configuration center have higher priority than those in `application.properties`
