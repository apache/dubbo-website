description: "Dubbo broadcast2 broadcast mode collects port responses from all providers"
---

Applicable scenario: for any Dubbo consumer, broadcast calls multiple service providers. The consumer is able to collect responses from all of the providers. 

{{% alert title="Notice" color="primary" %}}
support on `2.7.12` or above.
{{% /alert %}}

## Demo

- consumer demo

@Reference imports providers. Within the brackets, letting cluster = "broadcast2" represents doing one broadcast call that collects providers' responses. 

Broadcast calls all service providers one by one. Is able to return all service providersâ€™ execution outcomes (success or exceptions) completely and stores 
providers' responses in RpcContext. 

```java
@RestController
public class TestServiceConsumer {
    @Reference(interfaceClass = DubboHealthService.class,cluster = "broadcast2")
    private DubboHealthService dubboHealthService;
    
     @GetMapping("/health")
         public String broadCast(){
             try{
                 dubboHealthService.health();
             }catch (Exception e){
                 Map<String, String> m = RpcContext.getServerContext().getAttachments();
                 return m.toString()+"|"+"fail";
             }
             Map<String, String> m = RpcContext.getServerContext().getAttachments();
             return m.toString()+"|"+"success";
         }
}
```

- provider demo

```java
@Service
public class DubboHealthServiceImpl implements DubboHealthService {
    @Override
    public String health() {
//        int i = 1/0;
        return "i am provider2";
    }
}
```

- execution outcome

All providers succeed:

```
>curl http://localhost:8081/health
>{broadcast.results=[{"ip":"10.220.47.253","port":20880,"data":"i am provider1"},{"ip":"10.220.47.253","port":20881,"data":"i am provider2"}]}|success%  
```

Let one of the providers divide by zero:

```
>curl http://localhost:8081/health
>{broadcast.results=[{"ip":"10.220.47.253","port":20880,"data":"i am provider1"},{"ip":"10.220.47.253","port":20881,"exceptionMsg":"/ by zero"}]}|success%     
```
