## Control connections at server-side
Limit server-side accept to no more than 10 connections

```xml
<dubbo:provider protocol="dubbo" accepts="10" />
```
OR

```xml
<dubbo:protocol name="dubbo" accepts="10" />
```

## Control connections at client-side
Limit client-side creating connection to no more than 10 connections for interface `com.foo.BarService`.
```xml
<dubbo:reference interface="com.foo.BarService" connections="10" />
```

OR

```xml
<dubbo:service interface="com.foo.BarService" connections="10" />
```

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}
If used default protocol(`dubbo` protocol), and the value of  `connections` attribute is great than 0,then each service reference will has itself connection,else all service which belong to same remote server will share only one connection. In this framework,we called `private` connection or `share` connection.

If `<dubbo:service>` and `<dubbo:reference>` are both configured accepts/connections,`<dubbo:reference>` is preferred, refer to [Configuration coverage strategy](../../configuration/xml).

Because connection is connect on Server, so configure on provider side.
