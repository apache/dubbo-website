Since `2.0.5` dubbo starts supporting to use telnet command to govern services.

## How To Use

```sh
telnet localhost 20880
```

Or:

```sh
echo status | nc -i 1 localhost 20880
```

It is possible to extend command `status` to check more resources, pls. refer to [extension references](http://dubbo.apache.org/books/dubbo-dev-book-en/impls/status-checker.html) for more details.
