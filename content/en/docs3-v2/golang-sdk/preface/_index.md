Apache/Dubbo-go ([github.com/apache/dubbo-go](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-go))

It is a distributed RPC framework; it is the Go language implementation of Apache/Dubbo. It aims to provide developers with a convenient microservice application development experience.

Dubbo-go builds a bridge between Java and Go languages, interconnects with the gRPC/Dubbo/SpringCloud ecology, and relies on the Go language ecology to explore the technical dividends of the cloud-native era.
