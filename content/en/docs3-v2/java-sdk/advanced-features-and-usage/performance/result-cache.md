## Feature description

#### cache type

* `lru` deletes redundant caches based on the least recently used principle, keeping the hottest data cached.
* `threadlocal` The current thread cache, such as a page rendering, uses many portals, and each portal needs to check user information. Through thread caching, this redundant access can be reduced.
* `jcache` integrates with [JSR107](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=107%27) to bridge various cache implementations.
