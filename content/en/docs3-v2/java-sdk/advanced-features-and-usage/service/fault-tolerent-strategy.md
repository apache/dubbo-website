description: "When the cluster call fails, the fault tolerance solution provided by Dubbo"
---

When the cluster call fails, Dubbo provides a variety of fault tolerance schemes, and the default is failover retry.

Each node relationship:

* Here `Invoker` is an abstraction of `Provider` that can call `Service`, `Invoker` encapsulates `Provider` address and `Service` interface information
* `Directory` represents multiple `Invoker`, which can be regarded as `List<Invoker>`, but different from `List`, its value may change dynamically, such as the registration center pushing changes
* `Cluster` disguises multiple `Invoker` in `Directory` as an `Invoker`, which is transparent to the upper layer. The masquerading process includes fault-tolerant logic. After the call fails, try another one
* `Router` is responsible for selecting subsets from multiple `Invoker` according to routing rules, such as read-write separation, application isolation, etc.
* `LoadBalance` is responsible for selecting a specific one from multiple `Invoker`s for this call. The selection process includes a load balancing algorithm. After the call fails, it needs to be re-selected

## Cluster fault tolerance mode

You can expand the cluster fault-tolerant strategy by yourself, see: [Cluster Expansion](/zh-cn/overview/mannual/java-sdk/reference-manual/spi/description/cluster/)

### Failover Cluster

Automatic switching on failure, when a failure occurs, retry other servers. Usually used for read operations, but retries can introduce longer delays. The number of retries can be set by `retries="2"` (excluding the first time).

The number of retries is configured as follows:

```xml
<dubbo:service retries="2" />
```

or

```xml
<dubbo:reference retries="2" />
```

or

```xml
<dubbo:reference>
    <dubbo:method name="findFoo" retries="2" />
</dubbo:reference>
```

This configuration is the default configuration
{{% /alert %}}

### Failfast Cluster

Fail fast, only one call is made, and an error will be reported immediately if it fails. Usually used for non-idempotent write operations, such as adding new records.

### Failsafe Cluster

Fail safe, when an exception occurs, just ignore it. Typically used for operations such as writing to audit logs.

### Failback Cluster

The failure is automatically recovered, and the failed request is recorded in the background and resent at regular intervals. Typically used for message notification operations.

### Forking Cluster

Call multiple servers in parallel, and return as long as one succeeds. It is usually used for read operations with high real-time requirements, but more service resources need to be wasted. The maximum parallelism can be set by `forks="2"`.

### Broadcast Cluster

Broadcast calls all providers one by one, and if any one reports an error, it will report an error. Usually used to notify all providers to update local resource information such as cache or logs.

Now in the broadcast call, you can configure the failure ratio of the node call through broadcast.fail.percent. When this ratio is reached, the BroadcastClusterInvoker
No other nodes will be called, and an exception will be thrown directly. broadcast.fail.percent ranges from 0 to 100. By default, an exception is thrown when all calls fail.
broadcast.fail.percent only controls whether to continue to call other nodes after failure, and does not change the result (if any node reports an error, it will report an error). broadcast.fail.percent parameter
Effective in dubbo2.7.10 and above.

Broadcast Cluster configuration broadcast.fail.percent.

broadcast.fail.percent=20 means that when 20% of the nodes fail to call, an exception will be thrown, and no other nodes will be called.

```text
@reference(cluster = "broadcast", parameters = {"broadcast. fail. percent", "20"})
```

`2.1.0` started to support
{{% /alert %}}

### Available Cluster

Calls the currently available instance (only one is called), or throws an exception if no instance is currently available. Usually used in scenarios that do not require load balancing.

### Mergeable Cluster

Aggregate the call results in the cluster and return the result, usually used together with group. Aggregate the results by grouping and return the aggregated results, such as menu services, use group to distinguish multiple implementations of the same interface, now the consumer needs to call once from each group and return the results, and return the results after merging, so that You can implement aggregated menu items.

### ZoneAware Cluster

In the scenario of multi-registry subscription, load balancing between registry clusters. There are four strategies for address selection between multiple registries:

1. Specify the priority: `preferred="true"`The address of the registration center will be selected first

```xml
<dubbo:registry address="zookeeper://127.0.0.1:2181" preferred="true" />
```

2. Same center priority: check the area to which the current request belongs, and give priority to registration centers with the same area

```xml
<dubbo:registry address="zookeeper://127.0.0.1:2181" zone="beijing" />
```

3. Weight polling: distribute traffic according to the weight of each registry

```xml
<dubbo:registry id="beijing" address="zookeeper://127.0.0.1:2181" weight="100" />

<dubbo:registry id="shanghai" address="zookeeper://127.0.0.1:2182" weight="10" />
```

4. Default: Select an available registry

## Cluster mode configuration

Follow the example below to configure cluster mode on the service provider and consumer

```xml
<dubbo:service cluster="failsafe" />
```

or

```xml
<dubbo:reference cluster="failsafe" />
```
