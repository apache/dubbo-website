### Possible Reason

1. The `clazz` class does not implement the interface class of the current extension point.
2. The extension may be an interface or not exist.

### Troubleshooting and resolution steps

1. Check the extension class declaration, and there is no matching extension implementation class.
2. The extension implementation class needs to implement the extension point interface class and method.
