### Possible Reason

A custom executor may be used, and an exception was generated when writing the destruction method.

### Troubleshooting and resolution steps

Check whether `org.apache.dubbo.common.threadpool.manager.ExecutorRepository` is custom implemented, and check the custom `shutdown` method.
