### Possible Reason
This hint means that the value configured by the user does not match the data type required by the attribute itself. For example, the `dubbo.comsumer.threads` attribute can only accept numeric attributes, but the value entered by the user is mixed with letters.

### Troubleshooting and resolution steps
According to the [Configuration Item Reference Manual](/zh-cn/overview/mannual/java-sdk/reference-manual/config/properties/), find the wrong configuration item, check the type specified by the item, and check whether there is a type inconsistency.
