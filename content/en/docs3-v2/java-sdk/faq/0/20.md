### Possible Reason

1. The JVM has set the parameter `-XX:+DisableAttachMechanism`
2. Set a stack dump path that does not exist in the system. If it does not exist, the system will try to create it. A `SecurityException` occurs during creation.
   May not have permission.

### Troubleshooting and resolution steps

1. Check whether the JVM has set the above parameters.
2. Check whether the account currently starting the service has permission to create folders.
