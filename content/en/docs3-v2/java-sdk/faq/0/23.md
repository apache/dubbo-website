### possible reason

1. There is a circular reference in the data to be serialized, resulting in a stack overflow.
2. The version of the referenced jar package is low or there is a compatibility problem.

### Troubleshooting and resolution steps

1. If using FastJson, remove `SerializerFeature.DisableCircularReferenceDetect`
2. Check or upgrade the version to try.

You can use some third-party tools or `jstack [PID] > jstack.log` to analyze the stack information and locate it.
