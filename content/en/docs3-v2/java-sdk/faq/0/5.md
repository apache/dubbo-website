Other modules reuse the file-based caching mechanism of the Common layer (currently the metadata module), and the file caching mechanism of the Common layer "discovers" that the file size exceeds the limit.


### Possible Reason
1. The user has unreasonably configured the Java System Property (the Java system property configured with -D) `dubbo.mapping.cache.maxFileSize` or `dubbo.meta.cache.maxFileSize`
2. The cache file is corrupted due to file system or disk errors.


> `dubbo.mapping.cache.maxFileSize` and `dubbo.meta.cache.maxFileSize` do not show default values,
The default value of the maximum file size found according to the logic of `org.apache.dubbo.common.cache.FileCacheStore.LimitedLengthBufferedWriter` is: `Long.MAX_VALUE` ( 2<sup>63</sup>-1 ).



### Troubleshooting and resolution steps
1. Try reconfiguring the above **Java System Property (Java System Property configured with -D)**.
2. Delete the cache folder and restart **Provider** and **Consumer** (the location of the cache folder is usually `~/.dubbo`. If `dubbo.meta.cache.filePath` and `dubbo.mapping` are configured .cache.filePath` is that path).
3. If these **System Property** are not configured, please go to [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) to issue an Issue.
