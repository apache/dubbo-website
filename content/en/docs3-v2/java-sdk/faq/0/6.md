### Possible Reason

When a running thread is in `wait, sleep, join`, it is explicitly called `interrupt()`

### Troubleshooting and resolution steps

After a normal running thread calls the `interrupt()` method, the interrupt status of the current thread will be set to true, but the execution of the thread will not be affected.
You can operate according to the actual situation or check whether the business code is used incorrectly.
