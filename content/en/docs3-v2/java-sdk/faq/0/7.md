### possible reason

1. Generally, when `Class.forName(className)` executes this method, the current class of `className` cannot be found.
2. The business code shows that the current `className` class is excluded, so it is not found when loading.

### Troubleshooting and resolution steps

1. Check whether `className` exists in `Class.forName(className)`.
2. Check the business code to see whether some classes or packages have been excluded by using the configuration or scanning annotation `exclude`.
