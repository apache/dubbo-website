Service version or grouping mismatch.

### possible reason
1. The `service.group` configured on the Provider side does not match the `reference.group` configured on the Consumer side (that is, the configuration of the service group).
2. The `service.version` configured on the Provider side does not match the `reference.version` configured on the Consumer side (that is, the configuration of the service version).

### Troubleshooting and resolution steps
1. Make sure that the service group configurations on the Provider and Consumer side correspond.
2. Make sure that the service version configurations on the Provider and Consumer side correspond.
