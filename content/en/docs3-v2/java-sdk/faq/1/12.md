### Possible Reason
During the graceful shutdown of Dubbo, unregister by calling `destroyAll` of `AbstractRegistryFactory`.

During the process of destroying the `unexport` of `Registryprotocol`, the `getRegistry` of `AbstractRegistryFactory` will be used to try to obtain the registry that has been destroyed, which leads to the destruction of all instances of the "registry service".
