## Possible Reason
It may be that there is a problem with the parameter configuration of metadata, especially `metadataServiceProtocol` and `metadataServicePort`.

## Troubleshooting and resolution steps
1. Check whether it occurs at the same time as 1-18 error, if it occurs at the same time, first try to solve 1-18
2. Check whether the `metadataServicePort` port number conflicts. If the ports configured by Provider and Consumer are in conflict at the same time, a 1-17 error will be generated.
