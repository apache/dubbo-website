## Possible Reason

1. There is an incompatibility between the zk server version and the client version, and the connection cannot be made.
2. The zk service is not started normally or the firewall cannot provide external services.

## Troubleshooting and resolution steps

1. Confirm that the client version is consistent with the server version.
2. zk can start normally or provide normal external services.

You can use some third-party tools or `jstack [PID] > jstack.log` to analyze the stack information and locate it.
