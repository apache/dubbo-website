## Possible Reason

1. The address configuration of the registration center in xDS mode is wrong.
2. The firewall and third-party protection software make it impossible to provide external connections.

## Troubleshooting and resolution steps

1. Check whether the xDS configuration is correct and whether the Istio status is normal.
2. Check the firewall configuration or use the `ping` command of cmd for basic detection.
