## Possible Reason

1. ZK cannot connect or the connection times out.
2. The ZNode already exists at the time of creation.

## Troubleshooting and resolution steps

1. Check whether ZK configuration IP and port number are correct. Connection testing can be done using the third-party tool ZooInspector
2. According to the stack reminder ZNode information, judge whether the current node can be cleaned up.
