### Possible Reason
1. Errors 1-4 in registry.integration.RegistryDirectory are caused by the null invokerUrls in the refreshInvoker process, which can be ignored.
2. The 1-4 errors in registry.support.CacheableFailbackRegistry may be caused by the mismatch between consumer and provider, and the "null protection" is turned off.

### Troubleshooting and resolution steps
1. Make sure that the service group configurations on the Provider and Consumer side correspond.
2. Make sure that the service version configurations on the Provider and Consumer side correspond.
3. Check whether `enable-empty-protection` of the registration center is true (the default is true).
