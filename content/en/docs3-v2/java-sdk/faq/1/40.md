## Possible Reason

The route calculation time is too long, so the address notification cannot wait for an appropriate time to update the address.

## Troubleshooting and resolution steps

1. Check the application QPS, if the QPS is very high, this is the expected log
2. Check the implementation of custom routes, and check whether there are abnormal implementations, such as deadlocks, infinite loops, etc.
3. You can use some third-party tools or `jstack [PID] > jstack.log` to analyze the stack information and locate it.
