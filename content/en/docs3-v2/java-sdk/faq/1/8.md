### Possible Reason
1. An error may occur when the consumer logs out or unsubscribes due to the downtime of the registration center.
2. It may be that the corresponding provider has not been released successfully.

### Troubleshooting and resolution steps
1. Check whether the registration center is running normally.
2. Check whether the provider is released successfully.
3. Check whether the provider’s registry-related parameters such as `registry` `config-center` `metadata-report` are configured correctly.
