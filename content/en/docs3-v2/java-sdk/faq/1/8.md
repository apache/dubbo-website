### Possible Reason
1. An error may occur when the consumer logs out or unsubscribes due to the downtime of the registration center.

2. Check whether the provider is released successfully.
3. Check whether the providerâ€™s registry-related parameters such as `registry` `config-center` `metadata-report` are configured correctly.
