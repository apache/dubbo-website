### Possible Reason
1. Multiple Dubbo processes (or other Java processes) use the same cache file.
2. Due to the file system permission problem of the directory where the cache file is located, reading and writing fails.
3. The value of `dubbo.registry.file` is entered incorrectly.
4. Accidentally specify two registries to use the same file store.

> **Hint:**
If `dubbo.registry.file` is not specified, the registry service cache path defaults to the `~/.dubbo` directory
(where `~` is the user's HOME directory)

### Troubleshooting and resolution steps
1. Check the value of `dubbo.registry.file` for typos.
2. Check whether other processes use the same cache file.
3. If `dubbo.registry.file` is specified, check its permissions in the file system.
4. Check whether the situation of "two registration centers use the same file storage" occurs, and adjust if it occurs.
