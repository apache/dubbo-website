## Possible Reason

* Dubbo provides an SPI extension Merger interface that aggregates the responses of all downstream providers. When Dubbo loads the user-defined extension Merger interface, the loading configuration fails.

## Troubleshooting and resolution steps
1. Refer to the community SPI extension manual to check the implementation of the user-defined extension Merger interface, ["SPI Extension User Manual"](/zh-cn/docs3-v2/java-sdk/reference-manual /spi/).
