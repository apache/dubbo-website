## Possible Reason

* Conditional routing rules are not configured according to the specification, resulting in exceptions when executing conditional routing filtering.

## Troubleshooting and resolution steps
1. Refer to the community request routing example to adjust the conditional routing configuration, ["Request Routing Example"](https://dubbo.apache.org/zh/overview/tasks/traffic-management/traffic-routing/).
