## Possible Reason

1. The protocol configured on the client side does not match the protocol configured on the server side. (For example, the protocol configured by the client is the Dubbo protocol, but the server can only provide services of the Rest protocol.)


2. The registration center (or configuration center) is unreliable and pushes illegal data.



## Troubleshooting and resolution steps

1. Check the protocol configuration of both the provider and the consumer.
2. Update the version of the registry.
