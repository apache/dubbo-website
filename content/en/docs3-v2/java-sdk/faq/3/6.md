## Possible Reason

1. The current service parameters have been displayed as `deprecated`.
2. This reminder may appear for generic declaration classes.

## Troubleshooting and resolution steps

1. Confirm whether there is a display parameter `deprecated=true` in the URL
2. If this error occurs in the generic declaration class, it will try to create a proxy without the actual interface class.
