## possible reason

1. The server pipeline may be temporarily disconnected due to network reasons.
2. The currently used version is lower or you can check the current parameter configuration to see if `send.reconnect=true` is enabled, and the higher version defaults to true.

## Troubleshooting and resolution steps

1. Check whether the directly connected network is smooth and whether there is any packet loss.
2. Check the above parameter values, or try to use a higher version.
