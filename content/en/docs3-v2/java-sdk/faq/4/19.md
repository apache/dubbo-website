## Important Reminder
The meaning of this error code has been adjusted. For Dubbo 3.1.4, 3.2.0-beta.3 and previous versions of this error code, please refer to Error Code [0-2](https://cn.dubbo.apache.org/zh/docs3 -v2/java-sdk/faq/0/2/).

## possible reason
This error code indicates that the parameter value may no longer be correct.

At present, it appears that the same protocol is listening to multiple ports at the same time. Due to design limitations, a single protocol can only listen on one port, otherwise the port configuration will be overwritten.

## Troubleshooting and resolution steps
Adjust the monitoring relationship between protocols and ports.
