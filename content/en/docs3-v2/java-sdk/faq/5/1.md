## Possible Reason

1. The server where the configuration center is located is shut down or down.
2. Wrong IP or port number.
3. The firewall blocked the port of the configuration center by mistake.


## Troubleshooting and resolution steps

1. Check configuration center IP and port configuration.
2. Check whether the server is turned on and works normally.
3. Check whether the port used by the configuration center is allowed by the firewall or not.
