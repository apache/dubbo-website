## Possible Reason

1. Customize the implementation of the destruction method, and there may be exceptions when the business logic is running.
2. The service has not been gracefully stopped, and there may be cases where the business logic has not been processed.

## Troubleshooting and resolution steps

1. Check the custom implementation of the destruction method and business logic.
2. Check whether there is time-consuming business processing logic when the service is stopped.
