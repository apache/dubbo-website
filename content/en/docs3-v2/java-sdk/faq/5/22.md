## Possible Reason

1. The address configuration of the registration center is wrong.
2. The configured address information cannot be connected through the network normally.
3. The version of the configuration center client does not match the version of the actual server, and there is a compatibility exception.

## Troubleshooting and resolution steps

1. Check whether the configured address is correct.
2. Check whether the network is smooth and can be connected through a third-party client.
3. Check whether there is a compatibility matching problem, you can refer to the third-party website for version adaptation.
