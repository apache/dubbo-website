## Possible Reason

1. The service of the configuration center cannot be connected.
2. The configured protocol, IP, and port are incorrect.

## Troubleshooting and resolution steps

2. Check that the configured protocol, IP, and port are incorrect.
3. Check whether the version of the configuration center client used is compatible with the version of the server.
