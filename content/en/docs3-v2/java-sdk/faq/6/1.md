Network communication layer, failed to connect to the service provider service

## possible reason

The service provider's network is abnormally disconnected or blocked by firewalls and third-party tools, and cannot provide external services.

## Troubleshooting and resolution steps

1. If it is a rest connection, check whether the requested server configuration is correct.
2. Check whether the network communication is normal, you can use some simple cmd commands to detect, such as `ping` and so on.
