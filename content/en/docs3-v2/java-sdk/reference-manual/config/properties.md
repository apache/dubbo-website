### argument

Method parameter configuration. Corresponding configuration class: `org.apache.dubbo.config.ArgumentConfig`. This tag is a sub-tag of `method`, which is used to describe the characteristics of method parameters, such as XML format:

```xml
<dubbo:method name="findXxx" timeout="3000" retries="2">
   <dubbo:argument index="0" callback="true" />
</dubbo:method>
```

| Attribute | Corresponding URL parameter | Type | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| index | | int | <b>required</b> | | identifier | parameter index | version 2.0.6 or later |

| callback | <metodName><index>.callback | boolean | optional | | service governance | whether the parameter is a callback interface, if it is callback, the service provider will generate a reverse proxy, and the consumer can be reversely called from the service provider , usually used for event push. | Versions above 2.0.6 |

### parameter

Option parameter configuration. Corresponding configuration class: `java.util.Map`. At the same time, the label is a sub-label of `protocol` or `service` or `provider` or `reference` or `consumer` or `monitor` or `registry` or `metadata-config` or `config-center`, used for configuration Custom parameters, this configuration item will be used as an extension point to set custom parameters.

for example:

```xml
<dubbo:protocol name="napoli">
   <dubbo:parameter key="http://10.20.160.198/wiki/display/dubbo/napoli.queue.name" value="xxx" />
</dubbo:protocol>
```

You can also:

```xml
<dubbo:protocol name="jms" p:queue="xxx" />
```

| Attribute | Corresponding URL parameter | Type | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| key | key | string | <b>Required</b> | | Service governance | Routing parameter key | Version 2.0.0 or later |
| value | value | string | <b>Required</b> | | Service governance | Routing parameter value | Version 2.0.0 or later |

### Environment variables
The supported keys are the following two:

1. `dubbo.labels`, specify a list of key-value pairs configured in the URL, usually through JVM -D or system environment variables.

   Add the following configuration:

    ```properties
    # JVM
    -Ddubbo.labels = "tag1=value1; tag2=value2"
    # environment variables
    DUBBO_LABELS = "tag1=value1; tag2=value2"
    ```

   The final generated URL will contain two keys tag1 and tag2: `dubbo://xxx?tag1=value1&tag2=value2`

2. `dubbo.env.keys`, specify the environment variable key value, Dubbo will try to load each key from the environment variable

    ```properties
    # JVM
    -Ddubbo.env.keys="DUBBO_TAG1, DUBBO_TAG2"
    # environment variables
    DUBBO_ENV_KEYS = "DUBBO_TAG1, DUBBO_TAG2"
    ```

   The final generated URL will contain two keys DUBBO_TAG1 and DUBBO_TAG2: `dubbo://xxx?DUBBO_TAG1=value1&DUBBO_TAG2=value2`
### Other configuration
#### config-mode
**background**

Some types of configuration class instances can only appear once in each dubbo application (such as `ApplicationConfig`, `MonitorConfig`, `MetricsConfig`, `SslConfig`, `ModuleConfig`), and some can appear multiple times (such as `RegistryConfig` , `ProtocolConfig`, etc.).

If the application accidentally scans multiple unique configuration class instances (for example, the user misconfigures two `ApplicationConfig` in a dubbo application), which strategy should be used to deal with this situation? Is it throwing an exception directly? Is it to keep the former and ignore the latter? Is it to ignore the former and keep the latter? Or does it allow a certain form of coexistence (such as the attributes of the latter overriding the former)?

Currently, the only configuration class type in dubbo and the configuration modes/strategies allowed by finding multiple instances of a unique configuration type are as follows.

**Unique configuration class type**

`ApplicationConfig`, `MonitorConfig`, `MetricsConfig`, `SslConfig`, `ModuleConfig`.

The first four belong to the application level, and the last one belongs to the module level.

**configuration mode**

- `strict`: Strict mode. Throw an exception directly.
- `override`: override mode. Ignore the former and keep the latter.
- `ignore`: ignore pattern. Ignore the latter and keep the former.
- `override_all`: attribute override mode. No matter whether the attribute value of the former is empty or not, the attribute of the latter is overwritten/set on the former.
- `override_if_absent`: attribute override mode if absent. Only when the corresponding attribute value of the former is empty, can the attribute of the latter be overwritten/set on the former.

Note: The latter two also affect property overrides for configuration instances. Because dubbo has multiple configuration methods, that is, there are multiple configuration sources, and the configuration sources also have priorities. For example, a `ServiceConfig` is configured through xml and the attribute `version=1.0.0` is specified. At the same time, we configure `dubbo.service.{interface}.version=2.0.0` in the external configuration (configuration center), Before the `config-mode` configuration item is introduced, according to the original configuration source priority, `version=2.0.0` of the final instance. However, after the `config-mode` configuration item is introduced, the configuration priority rules are no longer so strict, that is, if `config-mode is override_all` is specified, it is `version=2.0.0`, if `config-mode is override_if_absent` If it is `version=1.0.0`, if `config-mode` is other values, the property setting/overwriting will follow the original configuration priority.

**Configuration method**

The configured key is `dubbo.config.mode`, the configured values are as described above, and the default policy value is `strict`. A sample configuration is shown below

```properties
# JVM -D
-Ddubbo.config.mode=strict

# environment variables
DUBBO_CONFIG_MODE=strict

# External configuration (configuration center), Environment of Spring application, dubbo.properties
dubbo.config.mode=strict
```
