- The _Dubbo protocol_ implementation of Dubbo3 is basically the same as the Dubbo2 version in terms of performance.
- Since the Triple protocol itself is built based on HTTP/2, the RPC call on a single link is not improved compared with TCP-based Dubbo2, but has a certain decline in some call scenarios. But the greater advantage of the _Triple protocol _ lies in the gateway penetration, versatility, and overall throughput improvement brought about by the Stream communication model.
- Triple is expected to have better performance in the gateway proxy scenario. In view of the current stress testing environment, this round of benchmarks has not yet been provided.

## 1.1 Environment


| | Description |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Machine** | 4C8G Linux JDK 1.8 (Provider) 4C8G Linux JDK 1.8 (Consumer) |
| **Pressure test case** | RPC method types include: no parameters and no return value, normal pojo return value, pojo list return value<br /><br />2.7 version Dubbo protocol (Hessian2 serialization)<br /> Version 3.0 Dubbo protocol (Hessian2 serialization)<br />3.0 version Dubbo protocol (Protobuf serialization)<br />3.0 version Triple protocol (Protobuf serialization)<br />3.0 version Triple protocol (Protobuf sets Hessian2 serialization) |
| **Pressure test method** | In a single-link scenario, the consumer starts 32 concurrent threads (the current machine configuration qps rt has a more balanced number of concurrency), and collects the pressure test data after continuous pressure<br /> The pressure test data passes https: //github.com/apache/dubbo-benchmark Get |

### 1.2.1 Comparison of different versions of Dubbo protocol

<br />Figure 3 Comparison of implementations of the Dubbo protocol in different versions<br />

- As far as the default combination of Dubbo RPC + Hessian is concerned, the performance of Dubbo3 and Dubbo2 is basically the same in different calling scenarios

### 1.2.2 Dubbo protocol vs Triple protocol

![//imgs/v3/performance/rpc-triple.svg](/imgs/v3/performance/rpc-triple.svg)

<br />Figure 4 Triple vs Dubbo<br />

- Simply looking at the point-to-point calls of Consumer <-> Provider, it can be seen that the Triple protocol itself is not dominant. Also using the Protobuf serialization method, the overall performance of the Dubbo RPC protocol is still better than Triple. <br /><br />
- Triple implementation will continue to be optimized in version 3.0, but it cannot completely change the situation where "RPC protocol based on HTTP/2" is at a disadvantage compared to "RPC protocol based on TCP" in some scenarios

### 1.2.3 Supplementary gateway scenarios

TBD<br /><br />

### 1.2.4 Simulate the throughput improvement of the Stream communication scenario

TBD
