## Function modification points

### 1. Nacos Group alignment (application-level service discovery)

In Dubbo 2.7.x, the group value configured on the Nacos Registry URL is aligned with the group group in the Nacos Registry. (group can be regarded as a soft isolation similar to namespace)

In Dubbo 3.0.x, the group configured on the Nacos Registry URL is not used by default, and all use DEFAULT_GROUP. (group no longer provides isolation)

In Dubbo 3.1.x, the group value configured on the Nacos Registry URL will realign the group grouping in the Nacos Registry.

Precautions:

1. Please check whether the group attribute has been configured on the URL of the registration center. If so, check whether the group of the server and the consumer are consistent. If not, please modify it to be consistent.
2. If you do not want the group to be realigned to the group grouping in the Nacos registry, you can configure the `dubbo.nacos-service-discovery.use-default-group=false` global property value to ignore this function
