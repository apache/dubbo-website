# Function modification points

## 1. Transitive dependency changes

* Dubbo version 3.2.0 no longer shade `hessian-lite` code in `dubbo-all` by default, but use transitive dependency transfer instead. If you don't need to use `hessian-lite` in your application, you can remove `hessian-lite` from dependencies.
* From version 3.2.0 of Dubbo, `gson`, `fastjson` dependencies are no longer passed in `dubbo-all`, if you need to use `gson`, `fastjson` in your application, please manually install `gson`, `fastjson` ` Dependencies are added to the application.
* Dubbo 3.2.0 version passes `fastjson2` dependency in `dubbo-all`.

## 2. Default serialization switch

* Starting from version 3.2.0 of Dubbo, the default serialization method is switched from `hessian2` to `fastjson2`. For applications upgraded to 3.2.0, Dubbo will automatically try to use `fastjson2` for serialization.

#### FAQ

#### Q1: Will it affect the intercommunication with lower versions of Dubbo?

Won't. Interoperability with lower versions still uses `hessian-lite`. For the principle, please refer to [Serialization Protocol Upgrade Guide](/en/docs3-v2/java-sdk/upgrades-and-compatibility/serialization-upgrade/).

#### Q2: Why switch the default serialization method?

`fastjson2` is a high-performance serialization framework with better performance than `hessian2`, natively supports JDK17, Native, etc., and is fully forward compatible with all functions of `hessian2`.
Since `hessian-lite` will become more and more difficult to maintain in the future, we decided to switch the default serialization method from `hessian2` to `fastjson2`.

#### Q3: What is the relationship with native JSON?

Dubbo uses the JSONB format of `fastjson2` instead of the native JSON format. The JSONB format corresponds to the JSON format, can fully represent JSON, and is a binary format.
For the specific protocol format, please refer to: [JSONB format](https://github.com/alibaba/fastjson2/wiki/jsonb_format_cn)

#### Q4: What if I don't want to use `fastjson2`?

If you don't want to use `fastjson2`, you can configure `prefer-serialization` to override the default configuration for `hessian2`. (such as `dubbo.provider.prefer-serialization=fastjson2,hessian2`) If there is no special requirement, we do not recommend continuing to use `hessian2`.

## 3. Default internal serialization tool switch

* Starting from version 3.2.0 of Dubbo, the **internal** serialization tool is switched from `fastjson` to `fastjson2` by default.

#### FAQ

#### Q1: Will it affect the RPC request traffic?

Won't. The internal serialization tool is used when Dubbo internally parses parameters, not the RPC transmission serialization protocol.

#### Q2: Why switch the default internal serialization tool?

From version 3.2.0 of Dubbo, the default transitive dependencies no longer pass `fastjson` and `gson`. For compatibility reasons, the default internal serialization tool is switched to `fastjson2`.

#### Q3: What if there is no `fastjson2` in my environment?

Dubbo supports automatic switching of multiple serialization frameworks. If there is no `fastjson2` in your environment, Dubbo will automatically try to switch to `fastsjon` or `gson`.

#### Q4: I want to specify the internal serialization tool of Dubbo, what should I do?

You can configure `dubbo.json-framework.prefer` parameters, such as `-Ddubbo.json-framework.prefer=gson`.

## 4. Triple protocol supports passing custom exceptions

* Starting from Dubbo version 3.2.0, the Triple protocol supports returning custom exceptions instead of only returning `RpcException`. If the service interface throws an exception, after Dubbo 3.2.0, the custom exception object will be returned by default according to the Dubbo protocol.

## 5. Push short protection is disabled by default

* Dubbo version 3.2.0 starts to disable push protection by default, even if the registration center pushes empty addresses, Dubbo will not keep the last batch of provider information.
  If you need to enable empty protection, you can configure `dubbo.application.enable-empty-protection` to `true`.

#### FAQ

#### Q1: How does disabling push short protection affect me?

In most scenarios it has no effect.
The purpose of push empty protection is that when the registration center fails and actively pushes empty addresses, Dubbo keeps the last batch of provider information to ensure service availability.
However, when most registration centers fail, the registration center will not push empty addresses, only in some special cases.
However, if the push short protection is turned on, it will have a greater impact on Dubbo's Fallback logic, heartbeat logic, etc., and bring troubles to the development and use of Dubbo.

#### Q2: I want to enable short push protection, what should I do?

If you need to enable push empty protection for high availability in production, you can configure `dubbo.application.enable-empty-protection` to `true`.
At present, it is known that turning on the push-out protection will cause the server-side application to upgrade from `2.6. In this scenario, the service call will fail.
In addition, after the push-to-empty protection is turned on, when the server address is really empty, there will be more heartbeat exceptions and log exceptions.
