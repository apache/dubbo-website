Used to count the number of RPC calls and the duration of calls, the extension interface is MonitorFactory, and the corresponding implementation class is DubboMonitorFactory.

### Possible Causes

Users can implement the MonitorFactory extension interface at this layer to achieve custom monitoring statistics strategies. In the implementation class of the custom monitoring statistics strategy, a runtime business exception has occurred.

### Troubleshooting and Resolution Steps

Check the business class of the `org.apache.dubbo.monitor.MonitorFactory` interface; the implementation method may contain logical errors in the code.
