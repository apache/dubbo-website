### Possible Causes

1. The `clazz` class does not implement the interface class of the current extension point.
2. The extension name may be an interface or does not exist.

### Troubleshooting and Resolution Steps

1. Check the declaration of the extension class and ensure there is a matching extension implementation class.
2. The extension implementation class must implement the extension point interface class and methods.
