### Possible Causes

A custom executor may have been used, and an exception was raised when writing the destroy method.

### Troubleshooting and Resolution Steps

Check whether a custom implementation of `org.apache.dubbo.common.threadpool.manager.ExecutorRepository` is used and inspect the custom `shutdown` method.
