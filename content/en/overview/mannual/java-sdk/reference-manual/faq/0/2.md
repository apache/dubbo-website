### Possible Causes
This prompt indicates that the value configured by the user does not match the data type required by the attribute itself. For example, the `dubbo.consumer.threads` property can only accept numeric values, but the value entered by the user includes letters.

### Troubleshooting and Resolution Steps
Refer to the [Configuration Item Reference Manual](/en/overview/mannual/java-sdk/reference-manual/config/properties/) to find the erroneous configuration item, check the specified type of that item, and verify if there is any type inconsistency.
