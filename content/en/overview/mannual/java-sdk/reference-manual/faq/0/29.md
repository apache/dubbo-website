### Possible Causes

You have enabled tracing in the configuration file, but the Tracer dependency was not found.

Currently, there are two supported Tracers, OpenTelemetry and Brave.

### Troubleshooting and Resolution Steps

Choose one Tracer dependency for your project:

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
    <artifactId>micrometer-tracing-bridge-otel</artifactId>
    <optional>true</optional>
</dependency>
```

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
    <artifactId>micrometer-tracing-bridge-brave</artifactId>
    <optional>true</optional>
</dependency>
```
