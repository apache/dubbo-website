Other modules reuse the file-based caching mechanism of the Common layer (currently the metadata module), and the file caching mechanism of the Common layer has "detected" that the file size has exceeded the limit.


### Possible Causes
1. The user has improperly configured the Java System Property (configured with -D) `dubbo.mapping.cache.maxFileSize` or `dubbo.meta.cache.maxFileSize`.
2. The cache file has been corrupted due to a file system or disk error.


> `dubbo.mapping.cache.maxFileSize` and `dubbo.meta.cache.maxFileSize` do not have explicitly stated default values, while the maximum file size default value found based on the logic of `org.apache.dubbo.common.cache.FileCacheStore.LimitedLengthBufferedWriter` is: `Long.MAX_VALUE` (2<sup>63</sup>-1) .
 

### Troubleshooting and Resolution Steps
1. Try reconfiguring the above **Java System Property (configured with -D)**.
2. Delete the cache folder and restart **Provider** and **Consumer** (the cache folder is generally located in `~/.dubbo`. If `dubbo.meta.cache.filePath` and `dubbo.mapping.cache.filePath` are configured, then the path will be that).
3. If these **System Properties** are indeed not configured, please issue a problem on the [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues).
