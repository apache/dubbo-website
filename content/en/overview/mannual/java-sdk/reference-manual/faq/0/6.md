### Possible Reasons

A running thread is explicitly interrupted by calling `interrupt()` while it is in `wait`, `sleep`, or `join` states.

### Troubleshooting and Resolution Steps

When a normally running thread calls the `interrupt()` method, it sets the current thread's interrupt status to true, but the thread's execution will not be affected. 
You can take action based on the actual situation or check if the business code has been misused.
