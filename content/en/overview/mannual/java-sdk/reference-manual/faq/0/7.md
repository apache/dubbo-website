### Possible Reasons

1. Generally, this occurs when `Class.forName(className)` is executed and the current class `className` cannot be found.
2. The business logic explicitly excludes the current `className` class, resulting in it not being found during loading.

### Troubleshooting and Resolution Steps

1. Check if `className` exists in `Class.forName(className)`.
2. Investigate the business logic to see if any configuration or scanned annotations use `exclude` to exclude certain classes or packages.
