### Possible Causes
During the graceful shutdown of Dubbo, deregistration is performed by calling `destroyAll` of `AbstractRegistryFactory`.

In the process of destroying `unexport` of `Registryprotocol`, there may be an attempt to obtain the already destroyed registry through `getRegistry` of `AbstractRegistryFactory`, leading to "Instances of Registered Service have been destroyed."
