### Possible Causes

1. Unable to connect to ZK or connection timeout.
2. ZNode already exists at the time of creation.

### Troubleshooting and Resolution Steps

1. Check if the ZK configuration IP and port number are correct. You can use third-party tools like ZooInspector for connection testing.
2. Based on the stack trace, determine the ZNode information to see if the current node can be cleaned up.
