### Possible Causes

1. The metadata center has been disconnected from the application service.
2. The data of the metadata center has been modified or corrupted.

1. Check if network communication is normal; you can use simple cmd commands for testing, such as `ping`, etc.
2. Use third-party tools to establish a connection and view the content.
