### Possible Causes
1. The 1-4 error in `registry.integration.RegistryDirectory` is caused by `invokerUrls` being empty during the `refreshInvoker` process, which can be ignored.
2. The 1-4 error in `registry.support.CacheableFailbackRegistry` may be caused by a mismatch between the consumer and provider, and the “empty protection” being disabled.

### Troubleshooting and Resolution Steps
1. Ensure that the service group configurations on both the Provider and Consumer sides correspond.
2. Ensure that the service version configurations on both the Provider and Consumer sides correspond.
3. Check whether `enable-empty-protection` in the registry center is set to true (default is true).
