### Possible Causes

The routing calculation takes too long, causing the address notification to not wait for a suitable time to perform the address update.

### Troubleshooting and Resolution Steps

1. Check the application QPS; if the QPS is very high, this is expected logging.
2. Check the implementation of custom routing to identify any abnormal implementations, such as deadlocks or infinite loops.
3. You can use some third-party tools or `jstack [PID] > jstack.log` to analyze stack information for diagnosis.
