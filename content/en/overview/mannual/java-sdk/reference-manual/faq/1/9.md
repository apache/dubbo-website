type: docs

### Possible Causes
1. Multiple Dubbo processes (or other Java processes) are using the same cache file.
2. Failure to read and write due to filesystem permission issues on the directory where the cache file is located.
3. Incorrect input for the value of `dubbo.registry.file`.
4. Accidentally specified two registries to use the same file storage.

> **Tip:**
If `dubbo.registry.file` is not specified, the cache path for the registry service defaults to the `~/.dubbo` directory
(where `~` is the user's HOME directory)

### Troubleshooting and Resolution Steps
1. Check if there are any spelling errors in the value of `dubbo.registry.file`.
2. Check if other processes are using the same cache file.
3. If `dubbo.registry.file` is specified, check its permissions in the filesystem.
4. Investigate if the situation of "two registries using the same file storage" occurred and adjust accordingly.
