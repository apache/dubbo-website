### Possible Causes

* Dubbo failed to call the service provider and started retrying.
* Dubbo continuously failed to retry calling the service provider.
* Dubbo reached the retry limit when calling the service provider.

### Troubleshooting and Resolution Steps
1. Check the network connection latency and other network resources between the consumer and the provider.
2. Use telnet or other tools to check if the corresponding port of the provider can respond normally.
3. Check if the provider program is running normally.
