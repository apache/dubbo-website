### Possible Causes

* Dubbo provides the SPI extension Merger interface, which aggregates responses from all downstream providers. Dubbo fails to load the configuration when loading user-defined extension Merger interfaces.

### Troubleshooting and Resolution Steps
> Refer to the community SPI extension usage manual to check the implementation of the user-defined extension Merger interface [“SPI Extension Usage Manual”](/en/overview/mannaual/java-sdk/reference-manual/spi/) .
