### Possible Causes

* Dubbo selects a provider from the list of providers to make a call during load balancing. If the provider list changes during the selection process, read/write conflicts may occur, leading to filtering exceptions.
* When the Dubbo retry mechanism encounters a failure in calling the provider, it will re-filter another provider for the call, and exceptions may occur during the re-filtering process.

### Troubleshooting and Resolution Steps
1. Check the list of providers in the registry and the availability of the corresponding providers.
2. Raise an issue in the community, providing on-site environment information and reproduction steps.
