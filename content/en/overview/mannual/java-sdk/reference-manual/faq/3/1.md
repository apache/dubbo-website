### Possible Causes

1. The protocol configured on the client does not match the protocol configured on the server. (For example, if the protocol configured on the client is Dubbo, but the server can only provide Rest protocol services.)
2. The registry center (or configuration center) is unreliable and has pushed invalid data.

### Troubleshooting and Resolution Steps

1. Check the protocol configuration on both the provider and consumer sides.
2. Update the version of the registry center.
