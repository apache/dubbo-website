### Possible Causes

1. The client has too many connections, causing slow response times and unable to timely send requests to the server.
2. Some network issues.

### Troubleshooting and Resolution Steps

1. Check if the network is functioning properly.
2. You can analyze stack information using some third-party tools or `jstack [PID] > jstack.log` for diagnostics.
