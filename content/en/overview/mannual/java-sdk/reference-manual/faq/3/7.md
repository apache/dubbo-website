The server did not receive a response within the time set by the client.

### Possible Reasons

1. The server's business processing logic is too complex to respond within the effective time.
2. The connection between the server and client is disconnected, causing network packet loss.
3. The server is under heavy load.

### Troubleshooting and Resolution Steps

1. Check if there is indeed a performance bottleneck in the server's business processing capability.
2. Ensure the network is functioning normally.
3. You can analyze stack information using some third-party tools or `jstack [PID] > jstack.log` for diagnosis.
