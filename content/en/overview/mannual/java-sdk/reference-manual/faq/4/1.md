### Possible Causes
This situation may occur in scenarios with a custom Protocol. Dubbo's SPI mechanism cannot find the Protocol specified in the URL.


### Troubleshooting and Resolution Steps
1. Ensure that the Consumer has the dependencies for the Protocol used by the server.
2. Confirm that the name of the SPI configuration file for the Protocol's dependency package is correct.
