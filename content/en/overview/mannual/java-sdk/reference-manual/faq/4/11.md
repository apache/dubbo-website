### Possible Reasons

1. The service provider has been shut down.
2. The caller's IP is not in the service provider's whitelist.
3. The specific service address requested does not exist.

### Troubleshooting and Resolution Steps

1. Check the startup status of the service provider.
2. Check or use third-party tools to test if the network environment is properly connected.
3. Based on the stack's serviceName, check or simulate the call in the management platform to see if it works properly.
