### Possible Causes

Currently using an unsafe serializer, which is not recommended. The specific configuration is: `serialization="java"`

> Java serialization is unsafe. The Dubbo team does not recommend anyone to use it. If you still want to use it, please follow [JEP 290](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/290) to set up a serialization filter to prevent deserialization leaks.

### Troubleshooting and Resolution Steps

Modify the `serialization` parameter value. Change the serialization parameter value within the protocol to something else, such as hessian2, fastjson2, etc.
