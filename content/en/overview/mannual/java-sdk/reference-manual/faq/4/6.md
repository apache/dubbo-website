### Possible Causes

This occurs when using a custom serialization method, and an error happens during the use of the custom SPI `org.apache.dubbo.common.serialize.Serialization` serialization method.

### Troubleshooting and Resolution Steps

Stack trace information can be analyzed using some third-party tools or by using `jstack [PID] > jstack.log` to obtain the content of the object that caused the error, and then modify it in conjunction with the custom implementation.
