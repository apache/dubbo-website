### Possible Causes

An error occurs during the `close` or `destroy` of various `Connect Clients`, which does not affect the final outcome.

### Troubleshooting and Resolution Steps

Stack trace information can be analyzed using some third-party tools or by using `jstack [PID] > jstack.log` for diagnosis.
