### Possible Causes

1. The configuration center service cannot be connected.
2. The configured protocol, IP, and port are incorrect.
3. There is a conflict between the version of the configuration center client used and the version of the server, preventing an effective connection.

### Troubleshooting and Resolution Steps

1. Check whether the status of the configuration center service is normal.
2. Verify that the configured protocol, IP, and port are correct.
3. Check if the version of the configuration center client used is compatible with the server version.
