### Possible Causes

1. The notification has been sent, but an unexpected error occurred in the business processing logic.
2. The configuration center cannot be connected, resulting in a timeout error.

### Troubleshooting and Resolution Steps

1. Check the custom business logic implementation for any runtime exceptions.
2. Check whether the configuration center can be connected normally.
