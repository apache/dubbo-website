### Possible Causes

1. The address of the registry is configured incorrectly.
2. The configured address information cannot be connected to the network properly.
3. The version of the configuration center client does not match the actual server version, leading to compatibility issues.

### Investigation and Resolution Steps

1. Check if the configured address is correct.
2. Check if the network is smooth and can be connected using a third-party client.
3. Check for compatibility matching issues, and refer to third-party websites for version adaptation.
