### Possible Causes

An exception occurs in the business code within the overridden `invoke` method of the custom filter extension class.

### Troubleshooting and Solutions
1. Use `ps -eaf |grep <error service>`
2. You can analyze the stack trace using some third-party tools or by using `jstack [PID] > jstack.log` for diagnosis.
