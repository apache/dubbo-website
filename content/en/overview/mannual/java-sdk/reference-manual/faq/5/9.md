### Possible Causes

1. Unable to connect to the configuration center's service.
2. Incorrect protocol, IP, or port configured.
3. Conflict between the version of the configuration center client and the server version, preventing a valid connection.

### Troubleshooting and Resolution Steps

1. Check if the status of the configuration center service is normal.
2. Check if the configured protocol, IP, or port is correct.
3. Verify whether the version of the configuration center client being used is compatible with the server version.
