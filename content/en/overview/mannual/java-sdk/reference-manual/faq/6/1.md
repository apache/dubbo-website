Network communication layer, failure to connect to the service provider's service.

### Possible Causes

The service provider's network is unexpectedly disconnected or intercepted by firewalls and third-party tools, unable to provide external services.

### Troubleshooting and Solution Steps
 
1. If it's a REST connection, check if the server configuration for the request is correct.
2. Check if the network communication is normal; you can use some simple CMD commands for detection, such as `ping`, etc.
