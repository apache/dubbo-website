### Possible Causes

The connection between the client and server has been refused. 
When the client is being destroyed, the server may be undergoing an election or other operations, resulting in an exception.

### Troubleshooting and Resolution Steps

The shutdown method can be queried based on stack information. Generally, no further action is required.
