### Possible Causes

1. There is a compatibility issue between the server version of ZK and the client version, preventing connection.
2. The ZK service is not started properly, or it cannot provide services externally due to firewall or other reasons.

### Troubleshooting and Resolution Steps

1. Confirm that the client version matches the server version.
2. Ensure that ZK can start normally and provide services externally.

You can analyze stack information using third-party tools or `jstack [PID] > jstack.log` for the diagnosis.
