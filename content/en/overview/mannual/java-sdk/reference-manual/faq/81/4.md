### Possible Causes

1. The ZooKeeper service is running abnormally or has crashed.
2. The version of the ZooKeeper client is incompatible with the version of the server and cannot connect.
3. The application server is disconnected from the ZooKeeper service.
4. Restricted firewall or third-party protection tools.

### Troubleshooting and Resolution Steps

1. Check the health status of the ZooKeeper service and the server it is on.
2. Check for compatibility issues between the ZooKeeper client version and the server's startup version, keeping the versions consistent.
3. Check if the port between the application server and the ZooKeeper service is open.
4. Check the settings of the firewall or third-party protection tools to see if they have been blocked.
