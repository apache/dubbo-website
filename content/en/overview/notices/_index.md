## Reporting security issues

The Apache Software Foundation takes a very active stance in eliminating security problems and denial of service attacks against its products.

We strongly encourage folks to report such problems to our private security mailing list first, before disclosing them in a public forum.

Please note that the security mailing list should only be used for reporting undisclosed security vulnerabilities and managing the process of fixing such vulnerabilities. We cannot accept regular bug reports or other queries at this address. All mail sent to this address that does not relate to an undisclosed security problem in our source code will be ignored.

If you need to report a bug that isn't an undisclosed security vulnerability, please use the bug reporting page.

The private security mailing address is: security@dubbo.apache.org

For more information about how the ASF deals with security potential problems see https://www.apache.org/security/
