Pixiu Gateway is used to manage Pixiu Proxy, whether it runs as a standalone application gateway or is integrated in Kubernetes as an application gateway. Through Gateway API resources, you can deploy and maintain Pixiu Proxy instances managed by this controller.

> Pixiu Gateway is currently in the initial experimental stage. More deployment methods and standard feature support will be added in the future.
