Apache Dubbo is an international open-source project with tens of thousands of enterprise users. It has been tested in large-scale cluster production environments for many years, influencing millions of developers and driving the development of a large microservices open-source ecosystem. Dubbo was incubated from enterprise practices and then open-sourced, quickly achieving success in the open-source community. A large number of production practice users are the core driving force for Dubbo's long-term advancement, stability, and activity.

## Dubbo's Application in Alibaba
Dubbo was designed to solve the development and governance issues of Alibaba's complex e-commerce microservices clusters. In 2020, Alibaba collaborated with the Apache Dubbo community to release the next-generation service framework for cloud-native architecture - Dubbo3, based on Dubbo2 & HSF2. Currently, Dubbo3 has fully upgraded HSF2 and Dubbo2 to become Alibaba's unified service framework, successfully running on the Double Eleven cluster with hundreds of thousands of applications and millions of nodes.

Dubbo3 has absorbed all the large-scale microservices cluster governance experience from the HSF2 framework, addressed some long-standing architectural design flaws in Dubbo2, and added a series of new features for cloud-native architecture.

* Combining the large-scale cluster practice experience of the HSF framework, Alibaba, based on Apache Dubbo and the needs of the open-source community, launched a new service framework for cloud-native architecture - Dubbo3. Dubbo3 has completed a thorough cloud-native architecture upgrade while fully compatible with the previous API mode.
* Dubbo's high scalability is an important premise for its wide applicability. Alibaba maintains a set of internally unique adaptation plugin systems based on the Dubbo3 kernel to achieve smooth upgrades. This includes registry extensions, routing component extensions, monitoring component extensions, etc.
* Almost all mainstream cloud vendors and mainstream microservices open-source communities provide Dubbo adaptation or hosting services.
