Pinpoint can help us quickly locate problems (of course, there are more than one solution). What is Pinpoint Pinpoint is an APM (Application Performance Management) tool for large-scale distributed systems written in Java. Inspired by Dapper, Pinpoint provides a solution to help analyze the overall structure of the system and how components within them are interconnected by tracing transactions across distributed applications. You should definitely check Pinpoint out If you want to understand your application topology at a glance monitor your application in Real-Time gain code-level visibility to every transaction install APM Agents without changing a single line of code have minimal impact on the performance (approximately 3% increase in resource usage) ServerMap Understand the topology of any distributed systems by visualizing how their components are interconnected. Clicking on a node reveals details about the component, such as its current status, and transaction count. Realtime Active Thread Chart Monitor active threads inside applications in real-time. Request/Response Scatter Chart Visualize request count and response patterns over time to identify potential problems. Transactions can be selected for additional detail by dragging over the chart. CallStack Gain code-level visibility to every transaction in a distributed environment, identifying bottlenecks and points of failure in a single view. Inspector View additional details on the application such as CPU usage, Memory/Garbage Collection, TPS, and JVM arguments.

Dubbo fixed below issues of the standard JDK SPI: The standard JDK SPI will load and instantize all the implementations at once. It will be a waste of resources if one implementation is timecosted, but never be used. We can't accquire the SPI name, if loading the SPI implementation is failed.For example: standard JDK ScriptEngine, get script type by invoking method getName(). RubyScriptEngine class will load failed if the depenency jar jruby.jar is missing, and the real error info will be lost. When user executes ruby scripts, the program throws exception that doesn't support ruby, but it is not the real cause. Enhance the SPI functionality by supporting IoC and AOP, one SPI can be easily injected by another SPI simply using setter. Appointment: In the jar file containing extension class [^1], places a config file META-INF/dubbo/full interface name , file content pattern: SPI name=the fully qualified name for the extension class , use new line seperator for multiple implementation. Example: To extend Dubbo Protocol, place a text file in the extension jar file: META-INF/dubbo/org.apache.dubbo.rpc.Protocol , content: xxx=com.alibaba.xxx.XxxProtocol content of the implementation [^2]: package com.alibaba.xxx; import org.apache.dubbo.rpc.Protocol; public class XxxProtocol implements Protocol { // ... } Configuration in config module In Dubbo config module, all SPI points have related attributes or labels, we can choose the specific SPI implementation by using its name. Like: dubbo:protocol name= xxx / SPI Features SPI Auto Wrap Auto wrap the SPI's Wrapper class. ExtensionLoader loads the SPI implementation, if the SPI has a copy instructor, it will be regarded as the SPI's Wrapper class. Wrapper class content: package com.alibaba.xxx; import org.apache.dubbo.rpc.Protocol; public class XxxProtocolWrapper implements Protocol { Protocol impl; public XxxProtocolWrapper(Protocol protocol) { impl = protocol; } //after interface method is executed, the method in extension will be executed public void refer() { //... some operation impl.refer(); // ... some operation } // ... } Wrapper class also implements the same SPI interface, but Wrapper is not the real implementation. It is used for wrap the real implementation returned from the ExtensionLoader . The real returned instance by ExtensionLoader is the Wrapper class instance, Wrapper holder the real SPI implementation class. There can be many Wrapper for one spi, simply add one if you need. With Wrapper class, you will be able to move same logics into Wrapper for all SPIs. Newly added Wrapper class add external logics for all SPIs, looks like AOP, Wrapper acts as a proxy for SPI. SPI Auto Load when loading the SPI, Dubbo will auto load the depency SPI. When one SPI implementation contains attribute which is also an SPI of another type, ExtensionLoader will automatically load the depency SPI. ExtensionLoader knows all the members of the specific SPI by scanning the setter method of all implementation class. Demo: two SPI CarMaker \uff08car maker\uff09\u3001 WheelMaker (wheel maker) Intefaces look like: public interface CarMaker { Car makeCar(); } public interface WheelMaker { Wheel makeWheel(); } CarMaker 's implementation: public class RaceCarMaker implements CarMaker { WheelMaker wheelMaker; public setWheelMaker(WheelMaker wheelMaker) { this.wheelMaker = wheelMaker; } public Car makeCar() { // ... Wheel wheel = wheelMaker.makeWheel(); // ... return new RaceCar(wheel, ...); } } when ExtensionLoader loads CarMaker 's implementation RaceCarMaker , the method setWheelMaker needs paramType WheelMaker which is also a SPI, It will be automatically loaded. This brings a new question:How ExtensionLoader determines which implementation to use when load the injected SPI. As for this demo, when existing multi WheelMaker implementation, which one should the ExtensionLoader chooses. Good question, we will explain it in the following chapter: SPI Auto Adaptive. SPI Auto Adaptive The depency SPI that ExtensionLoader injects is an instance of Adaptive , the real spi implementation is known until the adaptive instance is executed. Dubbo use URL (containing Key-Value) to pass the configuration. The SPI method invocation has the URL parameter\uff08Or Entity that has URL attribute\uff09 In this way depended SPI can get configuration from URL, after config all SPI key needed, configuration information will be passed from outer by URL. URL acts as a bus when passing the config information. Demo: two SPI CarMaker \u3001 WheelMaker interface looks like: public interface CarMaker { Car makeCar(URL url); } public interface WheelMaker { Wheel makeWheel(URL url); } CarMaker 's implementation: public class RaceCarMaker implements CarMaker { WheelMaker wheelMaker; public setWheelMaker(WheelMaker wheelMaker) { this.wheelMaker = wheelMaker; } public Car makeCar(URL url) { // ... Wheel wheel = wheelMaker.makeWheel(url); // ... return new RaceCar(wheel, ...); } } when execute the code above // ... Wheel wheel = wheelMaker.makeWheel(url); // ... , the injected Adaptive object determine which WheelMaker 's makeWheel method will be executed by predefined Key. Such as wheel.type , key url.get(\"wheel.type\") will determine WheelMake implementation. The logic of Adaptive instance of fixed, getting the predefined Key of the URL, dynamically creating the real implementation and execute it. For Dubbo, the SPI Adaptive implementation in ExtensionLoader is dynamically created when dubbo is loading the SPI. Get the Key from URL, the Key will be provided through @Adaptive annotation for the interface method definition. Below is Dubbo Transporter SPI codes: public interface Transporter { @Adaptive({ server , transport }) Server bind(URL url, ChannelHandler handler) throws RemotingException; @Adaptive({ client , transport }) Client connect(URL url, ChannelHandler handler) throws RemotingException; } for the method bind(), Adaptive will firstly search server key, if no Key were founded then will search transport key, to determine the implementation that the proxy represent for. SPI Auto Activation As for Collections SPI, such as: Filter , InvokerListener , ExportListener , TelnetHandler , StatusChecker etc, multi implementations can be loaded at one time. User can simplify configuration by using auto activation, Like: import org.apache.dubbo.common.extension.Activate; import org.apache.dubbo.rpc.Filter; @Activate // Active for any condition public class XxxFilter implements Filter { // ... } Or: import org.apache.dubbo.common.extension.Activate; import org.apache.dubbo.rpc.Filter; @Activate( xxx ) // when configed xxx parameter and the parameter has a valid value,the SPI is activated, for example configed cache= lru , auto acitivate CacheFilter. public class XxxFilter implements Filter { // ... } Or: import org.apache.dubbo.common.extension.Activate; import org.apache.dubbo.rpc.Filter; @Activate(group = provider , value = xxx ) // only activate for provider, group can be provider or consumer public class XxxFilter implements Filter { // ... } [^1]: Note: The config file here is in you own jar file, not in dubbo release jar file, Dubbo will scan all jar files with the same filename in classpath and then merge them together [^2]: Note: SPI will be loaded in singleton pattern(Please ensure thread safety), cached in ExtensionLoader","title":"SPI Loading"},{"location":"dev/SPI/#spi-loading","text":"","title":"SPI Loading"},{"location":"dev/SPI/#spi-config","text":"","title":"SPI Config"},{"location":"dev/SPI/#source","text":"Dubbo SPI is inherited from standard JDK SPI(Service Provider Interface) and makes it more powerful.

Close the URL paramters which no need to check. Use base class for abstaction for a variety of similar types, such as RMI, Hessian 3rd protocols which have generated interface proxy, only transfer interface proxy to Invoker to complete bridging, and public base class can do the logic.

Consumer and Provider are abstraction concepts, just want you have a more intuitive understanding of which classes belong to the client and server side, the reason not use Client and Server is that Dubbo uses Provider, Consumer, Registry, Monitor divide logical topology node in many scenes, keep the concept of unity. Cluster is external concept, the purpose of Cluster is that make various Invoker disguise to one Invoker, so that we just pay attention to the Invoker in Protocol layer, adding Cluster or removing Cluster will not affect other layers, because we don't need Cluster when only have one provider. The Proxy layer encapsulates the transparent proxy for all interfaces, and in other layers with Invoker as the center, turn Invoker into interface, or turn interface implementation into Invoker by Proxy only when exposuring to user. RPC still work even removing Proxy layer, but not so transparent, making remote service calling don't look like local service calling. Remoting is the implemetation of Dubbo protocols, you can remove Remoting if choosing RMI. The Remoting is divided into Transport layer and Exchange layer, Transport layer is responsible for one-way message transmission, it's abstraction of Mina, Netty, Grizzly, it also can extend UDP transmission. The Exchange layer encapsulates the Request-Response semantics over the transport layer. Actually Registry and Monitor are not at the same layer, they are independent nodes, draw them together by layer just for global view.

Based on ProtocolListenerWrapper class, make all InvokerListener and ExporterListener as list, perform call back before and after exposure and reference. All additional functions would be implementated by Filter , including Monitor. RPC details The detail process of exposing service by service provider The above image shows the main process of exposing service by service provider: First ServiceConfig class get the actual class ref that provides service(e.g. \u5982\uff1aHelloWorldImpl), then generating a AbstractProxyInvoker instance by the getInvoker method of ProxyFactory class, to this step, complete the transformation of specific service to Invoker , next is the process of converting Invoker to Exporter . The key of Dubbo processing service exposure is the process of converting Invoker to Exporter , the red part in the above image. Here we introduce the implementation of the two typical protocols, Dubbo and RMI: Dubbo implementation The transformation from Invoker of Dubbo protocol to Exporter takes place in the export method of DubboProtocol class, it mainly opens the socket to listen service and receive all kinds of requests sent by the client, and the communication details are implementated by Dubbo itself. RMI implementation The transformation from Invoker of RMI protocol to Exporter takes place in the export method of RmiProtocol class, the RMI service is implementated by Spring, Dubbo or JDK, and the communication details are implementated by JDK, which saves a lot of work. The detail process of serving service for service consumer The above image is the main process of service consumption: First, the init method of ReferenceConfig class calls the refer method of Protocol to generate Invoker instance(such as the red part in the above image), which is the key of service consumption. Then the Invoker is converted to the interface required by the client (such as: HelloWorld). For each protocol such as RMI/Dubbo/Web service, the details they call refer method generate Invoker instance are similar to the previous section. Invoker everywhere Because of Invoker is a very important concept in the Dubbo domain model, many of the design ideas are close to it. This makes Invoker permeate the entire implementation code, and it's really easy to mix up for people who have just started Dubbo. Let's use a simple image below to describe the 2 important Invoker : service provider Invoker and service consumer Invoker : To better explain the above image, we provide the below code examples of service consumption and providers: Service consumer code: public class DemoClientAction { private DemoService demoService; public void setDemoService(DemoService demoService) { this.demoService = demoService; } public void start() { String hello = demoService.sayHello( world ); } } The DemoService in above code is the proxy of service consumer in above image, user can call Invoker [^5] which implementate the real RPC by the proxy. Service provider code: public class DemoServiceImpl implements DemoService { public String sayHello(String name) throws RemoteException { return Hello + name; } } The above class would be encapsulated to be a AbstractProxyInvoker instance, and create a new Exporter instance, then find corresponding Exporter instance and call its corresponding AbstractProxyInvoker instance when network communication layer recieve request, so that real call service provider code. There are some other Invoker classes, but the above 2 are the most important.

If there are more maintenance personnel or changes, there will be a decline in quality. I am thinking, is there any need for everyone to abide by it, according to a habit when writing code, I have summarized it. The code process, especially the framework code, should always keep in mind the details. Maybe the following will be said, everyone will feel very simple, very basic, but always keep in mind. Considering these factors in every line of code requires a lot of patience. It is often said that the devil is in the details. Prevent null pointer dereference and index out of bounds This is the exception I least like to see, especially in the core framework, in contrast I would like to see a parameter not legal exception with detail information. This is also a robust program developer who should be prevented in the subconscious by writing every line of code. Basically, you must be able to ensure that the code that is written once will not appear in the case of no test. Ensure thread safety and visibility For framework developers, a deep understanding of thread safety and visibility is the most basic requirement. Developers are required to ensure that they are correct in the subconscious when writing each line of code. Because of this kind of code, it will look normal when doing functional tests under small concurrency. However, under high concurrency, there will be inexplicable problems, and the scene is difficult to reproduce, and it is extremely difficult to check. Fail fast and precondition Fail fast should also become a subconscious mind, assert at the entrance when there are incoming parameters and state changes. An illegal value and state should be reported at the first time, rather than waiting until the time is needed. Because when it is time to use, other related states may have been modified before, and few people in the program handle the rollback logic. After this error, the internal state may be confusing, and it is easy to cause the program to be unrecoverable on a hidden branch. Separate reliable operation and unreliable operation The reliability here is narrowly defined whether it will throw an exception or cause a state inconsistency. For example, writing a thread-safe Map can be considered reliable, but writing to a database can be considered unreliable. Developers must pay attention to its reliability when writing each line of code, divide it as much as possible in the code, and handle exceptions for failures, and provide clear logic for fault-tolerant, self-protection, automatic recovery or switching. The entry point ensures that the code that is subsequently added is not misplaced, and the original fault-tolerant processing is confusing. Safeguard against exceptions, but does not ignore exceptions The exception defense mentioned here refers to the maximum tolerance of the code on the non-crucial path, including the bug on the program. For example, the version number of program is retrieved by scanning the Manifest and jar package names. This logic is auxiliary, but the code is quite a bit. Although the initial test works well but you should add a try-catch block to cover the whole getVersion() function, if something goes wrong then print error message and return the basic version. Because getVersion() may encounter exception for specific unknown scene, or other developers mistakenly modify the logic (usually they won't remove try-catch). Otherwise if it throws an exception, the main process will be interrupted which we don't want to see. It should be controlled properly, do not abuse try-catch, and do not eat the exception silently. Reduce scope of variable and use final liberally If a class can be an Immutable Class, it is preferred to design it as an Immutable Class. The immutable class has natural concurrency advantages, reduce synchronization and replication, it can efficiently help analyze the scope of thread safety. Even if a mutable class, for references passed in from constructor then held internally, it is better to make this field final, so as not to be mistakenly modified. Don't assume that the field won't be reassigned if this field is private or this class is written by myself. One factor to consider is that this code may be modified by others. He may not aware your weak convention\uff0c and the Final is a invariant contract. Reduce misunderstanding when modifying, do not bury mine It is repeatedly mentioned that the code being modified by the others, and this is something developers should keep in mind. This other person includes the future of yourself, you always have to think about this code, someone may change it. I should give the modified person a hint, let him know my current design intent, instead of adding hidden rules in the program, or bury some easily overlooked mines, such as: use null to indicate that it is not available, the size is equal to 0 means black list, this is a mine. The next modifier, including yourself, will not remember to have such an agreement, may later change some of the other bugs, accidentally changed to here, directly detonated the fault. For this example, one principle is to never distinguish between null references and null values. Improve code testability The testability here mainly refers to the ease of Mock and the isolation of the test cases. As for the automation, repeatability, stability, disorder, completeness (full coverage), lightweight (fast execution) of the test, the general developer, plus the assist of tools such as JUnit can do it. Can also understand its benefits, just the matter of workload. Primary emphasis on unicity(only test the target class itself) and isolation(do not propagate failure). Nowadays there is too much emphasis on completeness, a lot of crossed and repeated test cases. It seems fine, but the more test code, the higher maintenance cost. A common problem is that modifying a line of code or adding an assertion causes more than 100 test cases to fail. It will cost a lot of time to fix these variance test cases. Over time, this test cases can't really reflect the current state of the code, and it will often be compromised to bypass. In the best case, modify a line of code, and only one line of test code does not pass. If the code is modified and the test case can still pass, that doesn't work, indicating that the scenario is not covered. In addition, Mockability is the basis of isolation, it hide the logic of indirect dependencies.

Classification of configuration First of all, the purpose is to have a variety of configuration, which can be roughly divided into: Environment configuration, such as: the number of connections, the timeout configuration, etc. Describe the configuration, such as: service interface description, service version, etc. Extension configuration, such as: protocol extension, strategy to expand, etc. Configuration format Usually environment configuration, using the configuration properties will be more convenient, because is some simple discrete values, with the key - value configuration can reduce the learning cost configuration. Describe the configuration, information more often, and even have a hierarchy, using XML configuration would be more convenient, because the tree structure configuration expression was stronger.If very complex, and can also custom DSL as configuration.Sometimes such configuration can also use the Annotation instead of, because the configuration and related business logic, in the code is also reasonable. Another extension configuration, which may be different.If only policy interface implementation class to replace, can consider the properties of the structure.If there is a complex life cycle management, may need to configure such as XML.Sometimes extended by registering interface provided. Configuration is loaded For environment configuration, in the Java world, comparing to conventional approach, was agreed in a project under the classpath for the name of the configuration properties, such as: log4j. Properties, velocity. The properties and so on.Product during initialization, automatically from the classpath under loading the configuration.Our platform of many programs use a similar strategy, such as: dubbo. Properties, comsat. XML, etc.This has its advantages, is based on agreement, simplifies the user to configure the loading process of intervention.But also has its disadvantages, when the classpath is the same configuration, may be loaded by mistake, and when this isolation, may can't find the configuration, and, when the user wants to configure into the unified directory, not very convenient. Dubbo new version removes dubbo.properties , because the contract often conflicts configuration. And to describe the configuration, because want to participate in the business logic, usually embedded into the application of life cycle management.There are more and more using spring projects, directly using the spring configuration is common, and spring permits custom schema, configuration simplified is very convenient.Also has its disadvantages, of course, is strongly dependent on the spring, can ask programming interface to do the matching scheme In Dubbo configuration is described, but also environment configuration.Part with spring schame configuration is loaded, in part, from the classpath scanning properties configuration is loaded.Users feel very inconvenient, so in the new version of the merged, unified into spring schame configuration load, also increases the flexibility of configuration. Extension configuration, usually to the configuration of aggregate demand is higher.Because the product need to find the third party implementation, add it to the product inside.Agreed in the Java world, usually in a specified file each jar package down load, such as: the eclipse plugin. The XML, struts 2 struts - plugin. XML, and so on, this kind of configuration can consider Java standard service discovery mechanisms, namely in the jar meta-inf/services placed under the interface class name file, content is an implementation class name of the class in a row, like encryption algorithm in the JDK extension, the script engine extension, new JDBC driver, etc., are all in this way.see\uff1a ServiceProvider Provider \u3002 Dubbo old version under each jar package through agreement, place called Dubbo - context. The spring configuration XML extensions and integration, the new version to use the JDK's own meta-inf/services, spring from too much dependence. Programmable configuration Configuration of programmability is very necessary, no matter in what way you load the configuration file, should provide a programming way of configuration, allows the user to not using a configuration file, complete the configuration process with code directly.As a product, especially the component products, usually require collaboration use and other products, when a user integration of your product, may need adapter configuration mode. Dubbo new version offers one-on-one configuration class with XML configuration, such as: ServiceConfig corresponding Dubbo: service / , and one-to-one attributes, this configuration file configuration and programming the consistency of the understanding, reduce the learning cost. Configure the default Configuration of the default, usually set the reasonable value of a regular environment, thus reducing the user's configuration.Is generally recommended that in online environment for reference, the development environment can adapt by changing the configuration.The default Settings, had better be in the outermost configuration do processing load.The underlying program if found configuration is not correct, you should direct error, fault tolerance in the outermost layer.If, when the underlying program to use, found unreasonable configuration values, just fill a default value, it is easy to cover up the surface, and trigger a deeper problem.And configuration of the middle layer, probably don't know the underlying USES a default value, some may be failure in the middle of the testing conditions.Dubbo first appeared in this problem, the middle layer with \"address\" as the cache Key, and the bottom, to \"address\" a default port number, lead to don't add port number \"address\" and add the default port \"address\" did not use the same cache. Configuration consistency Configuration is always implied some style or hidden rules, should as far as possible to keep its consistency.For example: a lot of functions have switch, and then have a configuration value\uff1a Whether to use the registry, the registry address. Whether to allow a retry, retries. You may agree: Each is to configure a Boolean type of switch, to configure a value. On behalf of the closed with an invalid values, N/A address 0 retries, etc. No matter which way, all the configuration items, should keep the same style, Dubbo selected is the second.Also, similar to that of timeout, retry time, timer interval.If a unit is second, another unit is milliseconds (C3P0 configuration item is) so, staff will be crazy. Configuration coverage Provide configuration, want to consider developers, testers, piping, the system administrator.Testers can't modify the code, and test environment is likely to be more complex, need to have some set aside for testers \"back door\", can be modified in the peripheral configuration items.Like spring is accomplished configuration, support SYSTEM_PROPERTIES_MODE_OVERRIDE , can through the JVM -d parameters, or like hosts agreed a cover configuration files, on the outside of the program, modify some configuration, easy to test. Dubbo support through the JVM parameter - Dcom. XXX. XxxService = Dubbo: / / 10.1.1.1:1234 directly make the remote service call bypass registry, point to point test.There is a kind of situation, developers to increase the configuration, can according to the deployment of online configuration, such as: dubbo: registry address = \"${dubbo. Registry. Address}\" / because only one online registry, this configuration is no problem, and the testing environment may have two registry, testers can't to modify configuration, changed to: dubbo:registry address=\"${dubbo.registry.address1}\" / \uff0c dubbo:registry address=\"${dubbo.registry.address2}\" / \uff0cSo this place, Dubbo support in the ${Dubbo. Registry. Address} value, through vertical dividing multiple registry addresses, used to represent a registry address. Configuration inheritance Configuration is also \"duplicate code\", there is also a \"generalization and elaboration\" problem.Such as: Dubbo timeout Settings, each service, and each method, should be can set the timeout.But a lot of service don't care about overtime, if required each method configuration, it is not realistic.So Dubbo adopted method inherit service timeout, overtime service timeout to inherit the default timeout, no configuration, opens up search. Dubbo, moreover, the old version all the timeout, retries, load balancing strategies are only in the service consumer configuration.But in the process of actual use, found that the service provider knows better than consumer, but the configuration items are used in consumer.The new version, joined in the provider can match these parameters, through the registry to the consumer,As a reference, if there is no configuration, consumer to provide configuration shall prevail, the equivalent of consumption ji-cheng fang the provider's advice configuration values.And at the time of the relay configuration registry, can also be on the way to modify configuration, so that achieve the purpose of governance, the equivalent of inheritance relationship\uff1aService consumers -- Registry -- Service provider Dubbo, moreover, the old version all the timeout, retries, load balancing strategies are only in the service consumer configuration.But in the process of actual use, found that the service provider knows better than consumer, but the configuration items are used in consumer.The new version, joined in the provider can match these parameters, through the registry to the consumer. Configuration backward compatibility Forwards compatibility is very good, as long as you guarantee configuration only grow, basically can guarantee forwards compatibility.But backward compatibility, but also should pay attention to, to prepare for subsequent to join the new configuration items.If a special configuration in configuration, you should make an appointment a compatibility for the \"special\" case rules, because the special case, probably will happen later.For example, have a configuration file is save \"service = address mapping\", one of the special line, is saved \"registry = address\".Now application load time to define \"registry\" the Key is special, do special processing, the other is \"service\".New version found, however, to add a \"monitoring center\" = address, at this point, the old version of the program will handle \"monitoring center\" as a \"service\", because the old code can't be change, compatibility is will be very troublesome.If previously agreed upon in the \"special\" logo + XXX for special treatment, follow-up will be more convenient.

The service framework is becoming more widely used. Every day, I have to help the endpoint user to resolve problems. Gradually, it is found that most of the problems are configuration errors, or duplicated files or classes, or network failure. So I prepare to add some \"fool-proof\" design to the further version. It may be very simple, but it is still a little help for troubleshooting speed. I hope that I can throw a brick to attract jade, and everyone can help to come up with more preventive measures to share. Check for duplicated jars The most annoying problem is that, if we have several jars with different version number at the same time, there will be a problem. Imagine that, a new version of the Class A may invoke a old version of the Class B, it's related to the JVM loading order. The problem may encounter occasionally and hard to resolve. So the first, let's try to avoid it. For each jar package, pick a class that will be loaded, check it for duplication for example: static { Duplicate.checkDuplicate(Xxx.class); } Utility class for check duplication\uff1a public final class Duplicate { private Duplicate() {} public static void checkDuplicate(Class cls) { checkDuplicate(cls.getName().replace('.', '/') + .class ); } public static void checkDuplicate(String path) { try { // search from ClassPath Enumeration urls = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResources(path); Set files = new HashSet(); while (urls.hasMoreElements()) { URL url = urls.nextElement(); if (url != null) { String file = url.getFile(); if (file != null amp; amp; file.length() gt; 0) { files.add(file); } } } // if there are more than one indicates duplication if (files.size() gt; 1) { logger.error( Duplicate class + path + in + files.size() + jar + files); } } catch (Throwable e) { // safe guard logger.error(e.getMessage(), e); } } } Check for duplicate configuration files It is also a frequently encountered problem that the configuration file is loaded incorrectly. Users often complain that they have the right configuration but program says something is wrong. After some troubleshooting, found that the configuration file is not even loaded. Many products put a default configuration file under classpath, if there are several, usually the first one loaded by JVM is effective. In order not to be bothered by such problem, just like checking duplicate jars, add this: Duplicate.checkDuplicate( xxx.properties ); Check for optional configuration The required configuration is estimated to be checked by everyone, because without it the program may not even start. However, for some optional parameters, some checks should also be made. For example, the service framework allows the service consumers and service providers to be associated with the registry, and allows direct configuring the service provider address to point-to-point direct connect. At this time, the registry address is optional, but if there is no point-to-point direct connect configured, the registry center address must be matched, and this time you have to check accordingly. Provide error message with a solution if possible It's hard to troubleshooting problem with a simple error message which has no detail information. For example, the last time I encountered a \"Failed to get session\" exception, just the few words. I'm wondering which session is wrong? What is the reason Failed? It makes me crazy, the problem happens in an production environment and it's hard to reproduce. The exception should have some basic context information, such as author info, operation system, failed reason. The best exception information should be given a solution, such as the above: \"From 10.20.16.3 to 10.20.130.20:20880 The network is unreachable. Please use telnet 10.20.130.20 20880 to test the network at 10.20.16.3. If it is called across data center, it may be blocked by the firewall. Please contact SA to grant access permission.\" etc. The above can even judge whether it is cross data center based on IP address. Another example is the spring-web context loading, If spring is not started when getBean, spring will report an error. The error message says: \"Please add: listener ... init-param ... \", just copy and paste. We should learn from it. You can deliberately make a common mistake and see if you can solve the problem yourself by the error message. Or we can write some solution of common problems in error message. And also the environment information Every time an application error occurs, the developer or QA will send the error message and ask the reason. At this time, I will ask some question again, which version is used? Is it a production environment or a development environment? Which registry center? Which project is it? Which machine? And which service? The problem is, some developers or QA can't tell the difference, it waste me a lot of time. So, it is best to log some environment information, we can make a wrapper. Decorate the Logger interface such as: public void error(String msg, Throwable e) { delegate.error(msg + on server + InetAddress.getLocalHost() + using version + Version.getVersion(), e); } Utility class for retrieve version\uff1a public final class Version { private Version() {} private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Version.class); private static final Pattern VERSION_PATTERN = Pattern.compile( ([0-9][0-9\\\\.\\\\-]*)\\\\.jar ); private static final String VERSION = getVersion(Version.class, 2.0.0 ); public static String getVersion(){ return VERSION; } public static String getVersion(Class cls, String defaultVersion) { try { // search version number from MANIFEST.MF String version = cls.getPackage().getImplementationVersion(); if (version == null || version.length() == 0) { version = cls.getPackage().getSpecificationVersion(); } if (version == null || version.length() == 0) { // if not found, extract from jar name String file = cls.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation().getFile(); if (file != null amp; amp; file.length() gt; 0 amp; amp; file.endsWith( .jar )) { Matcher matcher = VERSION_PATTERN.matcher(file); while (matcher.find() amp; amp; matcher.groupCount() gt; 0) { version = matcher.group(1); } } } // return version, return default if null return version == null || version.length() == 0 ? defaultVersion : version; } catch (Throwable e) { // ignore exception, return default version logger.error(e.getMessage(), e); return defaultVersion; } } } Dump before kill Every time there is a problem with the production environment, everyone panics. Usually the most direct way is to rollback and restart, to reduce the downtime. So that the scene is destroyed, and it's hard to check the problem afterwards. Some problem is hard to reproduce in development environment and may happen under hard pressure. It is unlikely let the developer or Appops manually backup all the data before. Therefore, it is best to call dump before the kill script to backup automatically and avoid mistake.

Finally decided to adopt the JDK standard SPI extension mechanism, see: Java. Util. The ServiceLoader , namely extension in the jar package meta-inf/services / directory placed with interface of text files, with the same content for interface implementation class name, multiple separate implementation class name with a newline.Need to expand Dubbo agreement, for example, simply by XXX.

All plug-in and agreed, must be marked with: @ the Extension (\" name \"), as the identity of the name, after loading is used to configure option. Step 2 each extension point encapsulate a change factor, only to maximize reuse Each extension point implementers, usually only care about one thing, now the extension points, is not entirely separate.Such as: Failover, the Route, LoadBalance, Directory not completely separate, all written by RoutingInvokerGroup died. Again, for example, protocol extension, the extension may just want to replace the serialization way, or just replace transmission mode, and Remoting and Http can also reuse serialization, etc.In this way, the need for transport, the client, the server implementation, protocol parsing, data serialization, allow different extension point. After break up, the design is as follows: Step 3, the entire pipeline design, logic framework itself, are implemented using cross section intercept Now a lot of logic, are placed in the base class implementation, then by the method of template back to the realization of the tone categories, including: local, mock, generic, echo, token, accesslog, monitor, count, limit, etc., can use the Filter to realize all split, each function is called a ring on the chain.Such as: (the base class template method) public abstract AbstractInvoker implements Invoker { public Result invoke(Invocation inv) throws RpcException { // Pseudo code active ++; if (active max) wait(); doInvoke(inv); active --; notify(); } protected abstract Result doInvoke(Invocation inv) throws RpcException } To: (chain filter) public abstract LimitFilter implements Filter { public Result invoke(Invoker chain, Invocation inv) throws RpcException { // Pseudo code active ++; if (active max) wait(); chain.invoke(inv); active --; notify(); } } Step 4, a minimum concept, consistent conceptual model Keep the concept of as little as possible, help to understand, for open systems is particularly important.In addition, the interface can use a consistent conceptual model, can guide each other, and reduce the model transformation, For example, Invoker method signature as follows: Result invoke(Invocation invocation) throws RpcException; The Exporter method signature as follows: Object invoke(Method method, Object[] args) throws Throwable; But they are the same, only is a on the client side, one on the server side, different model classes are applied. For example, the URL string, parse and assembled, not a URL model classes, and the Parameters of the URL, but sometimes the Map, and sometimes the Parameters class wrapping, export(String url) createExporter(String host, int port, Parameters params); Use consistent model: export(URL url) createExporter(URL url); For example, the existing: Invoker, Exporter, InvocationHandler, FilterChainAre actually invoke behavior at different stages, can abstract away completely, unified for the Invoker, reduce the concept.

The API and SPI separation Framework or component there are generally two types of customers, one is a consumer, is an extension.API (Application Programming Interface) is used to users, and SPI (Service dojo.provide Interface) is used to expand.At design time, try to put them off, and don't mix.In other words, the user is can't see write the implementation of the extension. For example, a Web framework, it has an API interface to call the Action, there is a the execute () method, which is for the user to write business logic.Then, Web frameworks have a SPI interface to extend the control output, such as velocity templates output or a json output, etc.If this Web framework using an inheritance VelocityAction and a JsonAction as extension of the Action, with output velocity templates will inherit VelocityAction, want to use the json output will inherit JsonAction, this is the opposite of the API and SPI no separation example, SPI interface in the API interface. Is a reasonable way, there is a separate Renderer interface, VelocityRenderer and JsonRenderer implementation, Web framework will transfer the output of the Action to the Renderer interface for rendering output. Service domain/entity/session domains separation Any framework or component, there will always be the core domain model, such as: Spring Bean, Struts Action, Service of Dubbo, Napoli Queue, and so on.The core areas of the model and its component is called physical domain, it represents our goal to operate on itself.Physical domain is thread-safe, usually either through the same class, sync, or copy the way. Service domain, that is, behavior domain, it is the function of the components, but also is responsible for the entity and session domains of life cycle management, such as Spring ApplicationContext, Dubbo ServiceManager, etc.Service domain objects often is heavy, and is thread-safe, and serve all calls to a single instance. What is a session?Is an interactive process.Session key is the concept of context, the context is what?For example, we said: \"old place\", the \"old place\" is the context information.Why do you say \"old place\" other person will know, because we defined earlier the specific content of the \"old place\".So, the context often hold state variables in the process of interaction, etc.The session object, were generally mild and every request to create an instance, destroyed after the request.In short: the meta information held by the entity domain, the temporary state of a request by the session domain, by the service domain throughout the entire process. On the important process to interceptor interface If you want to write a remote invocation framework, the remote call block the process should have a unified interface.If you want to write an ORM framework, that at least the SQL execution, the Mapping process to intercept interface;If you want to write a Web framework, the request execution should be interception interfaces, and so on.No common framework can Cover all requirements, allowing external behavior, is the basic extension of the framework.Before a remote call, so that if someone wants to verify ordered CARDS, verification of black and white list, log statistics;If someone wants to add paging under packing before SQL execution, do data access control, statistics under the SQL execution time.If someone wants to check before the request execution, packaging, input and output flow request quantity statistics, and so on, can accomplish on their own, rather than into frame inside.Interception interfaces, usually to encapsulate process itself with an object, to the interceptor chain, such as: remote calls the main process for the invoke (), the interceptor interface to invoke usually (Invocation), Invocation object encapsulates the would have the execution context, and Invocation in an invoke () method, performed by the interceptor decide when, at the same time, also on behalf of the interceptor Invocation itself, such a interceptor Invocation is actually the process of packaging the next interceptor, until the last interceptor Invocation is packing the final invoke () process;Similarly, the main process for the execute SQL (), the interceptor interface is usually the execute (Execution), principle.Can implement ways, of course, the above is only for example. The important status of sending events and set aside to monitor interface Here to tell the difference between an event and the interceptor above, the interceptor is in the process of intervention, it is part of the process, is based on process behavior, and event is based on state data, any behavior changes of the same condition, the event should be consistent.Event is usually after the event notification is a Callback interface, the method name is usually past tense, such as onChanged ().Remote invocation framework, for example, when the network disconnect or even should send out an event, when there is an error can also be considered an event, such peripheral applications could be observed within the framework of change, make corresponding adjustment. Extension interface functions as a single, composability For example, the remote invocation framework agreement is to replace it.If only provide a general extension interface, switch can deal, of course, but the protocol support can be subdivided into the underlying communication, serialization, dynamic proxy mode and so on.If the interface split, orthogonal decomposition, will be easier to reuse existing logical extension, and just replace a part of the implementation strategy.Of course the decomposition the granularity of the need to grasp. Micronucleus plug-in, equal treatment to the third party \"A good framework of development, abide by the concept of micronucleus.Eclipse is OSGi microkernel, Spring's microkernel is the BeanFactory, Maven microkernel is breadth.With functional core is usually should not be, but a life cycle and integrated container, so that each function can interact through the same way and extension, and any function can be replaced.If they do not microkernel, must be at least equal treatment to a third party, namely, the author can realize the function of extension should can be done by extending all the way.The author want to regard themselves as extension, so as to ensure framework of sustainability and stability of the outside introversion. Don't control the external object lifecycle Such as the above said the Action using the interface and the Renderer extension interface.Framework if let users or extend the Action or the Renderer implementation class name of the class or kind of meta information submitted, then internally by reflecting newInstance () to create an instance of this framework is to control the Action or the Renderer implementation class life cycle, the Action or the Renderer physical, frameworks do it himself, external extension or integration are powerless.Good idea is to let the user or extend the Action or submitted to the realization of the Renderer class instance, framework just use these instances, is how to create these objects, how to destroy, had nothing to do with frame, frame up to provide assistant management tools, rather than absolute control. Configurable must be programmable, and maintain friendly CoC conventions Framework using the environment uncertainty because of the many, there will always be some configuration, usually to a specified name classpath straight sweep configuration, or startup allows you to specify the configuration path.As a common framework, should do all can do configuration file must be able to programmatically, or when the user needs to be your frame with another frame integration will bring a lot of unnecessary trouble. In addition, as far as possible do a standard contract, if the user has to do things by some sort of agreement, there is no need for the configuration items.Such as: configuration templates location, you can agree, if in the templates directory doesn't have to match, if you want to change the directory, and configuration. Distinguish between commands and queries, clear pre-conditions and post-conditions This is part of the design by contract, try to keep to a return value method is to query methods, void return method is to command.Query methods are usually idempotence, without side effects, also is not change any state, the n results are the same, such as the get a property value, or query a database record.Command is to point to have side effects, namely will change state, such as set a value, or update a database record.If you have modified the status of the operation, do a query returns again, if possible, to split it into writing reading separation of the two methods, such as: User deleteUser (id), delete users and returns the deleted users, consider to the getUser () and void deleteUser ().In addition, each method is front-facing assert that the legitimacy of the incoming parameters, as far as possible the rear assertion returns the legitimacy, and documented.

Here are some Dubbo principle and method of use. The log Logging is one of the most commonly used way to find, discover problems.Log quality is often neglected, there is no log on using expressly agreed upon.Attaches great importance to the use of the Log, and improve the concentration of the Log information.Log too much, too much chaos, could lead to useful information. To effectively use this tool to note: Record the contents of the stipulated strictly WARN, the ERROR level WARN that can restore the problem without human intervention. The ERROR says requires human intervention. With such agreement, the regulatory system found in the ERROR log file of the string will call the police, and to minimize the occurrence.Excessive alarm can let a person tired, make the person lose vigilance in alarm, make the ERROR log.Along with artificial, regularly check the WARN level information to assess the degree of \"subhealth\" system. In the log, as much as possible to collect key information What is the key information? Site information at the time of the problem, namely the screening questions to use information.Such as service invocation fails, to give the use of Dubbo version, the service provider's IP, which is used in the registry;Which service invocation, which method and so on.This information if not given, then later artificial collection, problem after the site may have already can't recover, increase the difficulty of the problem. If possible, the cause of the problem and the solution is given.This makes maintenance and problem solving becomes simple, rather than seeking savvy (often the implementer) for help. Don't duplicate records many times the same or a class of problems The same or a kind of abnormal log continuous there dozens of times, still can often see.The human eye is easy to miss under the different important log information.Try to avoid this situation.Will appear in the foreseeable, it is necessary to add some logic to avoid. As a symbol for a question, a problem after log Settings after sign and avoid a repeat of the log.The problem clear sign after recovery. Although a bit troublesome, but do ensure log information concentration, the more effective for monitoring. Limit set Resources are limited, CPU, memory, IO, etc.Don't cry because it is outside of the request, the data is not limited.

The active contributor is elected as a committer At the late development stage, an active contributor can be elected as a committer. See how to become a committer Second: The individual contributor signs ICLA 1, Apache ID Choose a Apache ID not in the apache committers list page . 2, Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA): Download the ICLA template . After filling the icla.pdf with personal information correctly, print, sign, scan, and send it in mail as an attachment to the secretary secretary@apache.org, the secretary will help to create the Apache user ID. At the same time, a your-id@apache.org mailbox will be created. You can see if the user has been created on the [apache committers list page (http://people.apache.org/committer-index.html). Third: Join The Apache Developer Group 1, login via the Apache account tool , when you login at the first time, you can select the \"Change password?\" checkbox to get the initial password. Then the initial password will be sent to the forward mailbox (the developer mail recorded in the project incubator proposal) 2, about Apache mailbox: does not have its own mail content storage server. It needs to borrow the mail content storage and mail sending functions of other mail providers. In many voting sessions, Apache mailbox is recommended. There is a question about how to configure the apache.org mailbox forwarding function using other mailboxes. 1) inbox: to receive mails that sent to youer-id@apache.org mailbox. The forward mailbox configured in the Apache account tool in the first step can use the forward mailbox to pick up incoming mail. 2) the Outbox: emails sent out will show the sender as your-id@apache.org account. Please refer to: set up Apache mailbox guide and Gmail mailbox setting . In other mailbox service settings, this forwarding mode is not easy to find. Gmail is the most convenient, which is recommended (no advertising). 3, Modify the homepage URL option in the edit page, homepage link of your account can be added in apache committer index page 4, Modify the GitHub account in the edit page, and an email will be sent to invite you to join the github.com/apache-commiiters group. Now, please learn from the way ASF works to do some basic preparation of ASF development. Fourth: To obtain write permission of the project Operation of the GitBox account link tool 1, Apache account authorization According to the prompt, the OAuth protocol of Apache account is authorized to login. 2, Github account authorization According to the prompt, the OAuth protocol of Github account is authorized to login. 3, Set up GitHub account in github.com, two-factors authorization (2FA) 1) install \"Google Authenticator\" app on your cell phone 2), Following the authorized GitHub 2FA wiki , you can operation step by step . In the two-factors authorization authentication (2. Scan this barcode with your app.) page, it is not recommended to select a two-dimensional code with a cell phone, because some of the cell phones will not be able to scan. Please open the cell phone \"Google Authenticator\" app, click \"+\" to select \"input the secret key\": write the GitHub account in the account name input box. In your \"secret key\" input box, write the text of the \"enter this text code\" link in the open web page. After clicking \"add\" in app, 6 digit dynamic will be generated for this account. Write the 6 digit number to the text box in the web page, and then click \"Enable\". In this way, the 2fa is set successfully. 3), logout and login to Github again, and one more step will appear after entering user name and password. Fill in the 6 digit number dynamic password generated by the app 4),It will take about half an hour, and you will be notified by mail that you have joined the XX project-committers developer group. You can also check it in the [apache teams] (https://github.com/orgs/apache/teams) page yourself. 5), After the 2fa has been submitted, you will have the permission check problem for the cloned projects. The solution is one of below two: A. Apply for Access Token When access token is generated on GitHub, the token where the instruction line needs a password is pasted. Refer to website referenced link one and referenced link two B. switch to SSH ssh-keygen then paste the content in the pub file into GitHub. Note : ensure that GitHub's 2fa is \"enabled\". When you set 2fa to \"off\", it will be delisted by the corresponding Apache committer write permission group until you set it up again. Fifth: other The Apache way See wiki . The community is more important than the code If not discussed in the community (mailing list), just as it did not happen. Add your name Please update Dubbo incubator status page to add your name.

Then the modifications and taggings related to ${release_version} Release Candidates are applied to ${release_version}-release branch, and is merged into the master branch after the final release. First of all, verify that the maven component packing, source packing, signature, etc are working properly on the ${release_version}-release branch. shell $ mvn clean install -Papache-release $ mvn deploy This push the snapshot package to the maven central repository. ~~Release with maven-release-plugin~~ ( Deprecated \uff0cSkip this step and refer to next step) ~~verify with dryRun~~ shell $ mvn release:prepare -Prelease -Darguments=\"-Dmaven.test.skip=true\" -DautoVersionSubmodules=true -Dusername=YOUR GITHUB ID -DdryRun=true ~~After verification, run release:prepare~~ shell $ mvn release:clean $ mvn release:prepare -Prelease -Darguments=\"-Dmaven.test.skip=true\" -DautoVersionSubmodules=true -Dusername=YOUR GITHUB ID -DpushChanges=false If you are promted to input password for pushing to GitHub (basically including adding new commits and tags), do not input your login password of GitHub. Use Personal access tokens instead. You can go to https://github.com/settings/profile, click Developer settings - Personal access tokens , and generate a new token if not. Please refer to this guide for more infomation. you need to choose the release artifactId, next artifactId and the release tag, the default tag is dubbo-parent-xxxx, you need to change it to dubbo-xxxx After executing the above commands, you will find that: 1. source-release.zip and bin-release.zip are generated under dubbo-distribution directory, please unzip it and check the file structure 2. -DpushChanges=false tells maven not to push the commits and tags to the remote repostiroy. If not specified, the version tag will be pushed to github repository, you will see a commit called [maven-release-plugin] prepare release dubbo-x.x.x added. 3. The branch version is upgraded to ${release_version+1}-SNAPSHOT automatically. If -DpushChanges=true is specified, the modifications will be pushed to the remote repository, you will see a commit called [maven-release-plugin] prepare for next development iteration added. If -DpushChanges=false is specified, you will have to manually push the commit to remote repository before go to next step. ~~Run release:perform~~ shell $ mvn release:perform -Prelease -Darguments=\"-Dmaven.test.skip=true\" -DautoVersionSubmodules=true -Dusername=YOUR GITHUB ID Maven will download the source code from the tag you just pushed, compile it, and deploy to remote maven repsoitry in staging state. use mvn deploy to deploy Requirement\uff1amaven 3.5+ modify pom version from 2.7.x-SNAPSHOT to 2.7.x . You can search the full-text in the dubbo project. $ mvn clean install -Prelease $ mvn deploy -Prelease -DskipTests After this, maven will deploy jar to remote maven repsoitry in staging state. Note When you deploy the package into repository, it will be interrupted for network. So you must restart to desploy. The problem is that missing package occurred many times at deploying. So you should check the quantity of package, especially parent package. Prepare Apache Release Prepare the svn local environment (Apache hosting the release content of project by svn) Checkout dubbo to local directory shell $ svn checkout https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/dubbo Assume that the local directory is ~/apache/dubbo The current release version is ${release_version}, new directory shell $ cd ~/apache/dubbo # dubbo svn root directory $ mkdir ${release_version} Add public key to KEYS file if you are the first time to be a release manager. KEYS is mainly used to allow people who participate in the voting to be imported locally to verify the correctness of the sign. shell $ (gpg --list-sigs your name gpg --armor --export your name ) KEYS For more information on how to get your key id, please refer to this guide Copy the source.zip package from the Dubbo root directory to the svn local repository dubbo/${release_version} Generate sha512 sign For source-release.zip shell $ shasum -a 512 apache-dubbo-${release_version}-source-release.zip apache-dubbo-${release_version}-source-release.zip.sha512 For bin-release.zip Please add -b paramter when generating sha512 for bin-release.zip, which indicates it is a binary file. shell $ shasum -b -a 512 apache-dubbo-${release_version}-bin-release.zip apache-dubbo-${release_version}-bin-release.zip.sha512 You should generate something like this: b8f13d1df6d6c9a1facc72fafc00b2d22bea1e600517c507467d8fca2f776a7a3877101742da53114bfa629ca5b941eb4d9ef989de43f0833e2a794e7ccf5c8a *apache-dubbo-spring-boot-project-2.7.0-bin-release.zip Note there is a * sign before the file name. If the binary release is accompanied with the source release. Run the following command in the dubbo-distribution module: shell $ mvn install Go to target directory, copy bin-release.zip and bin-release.zip.asc to svn local repository dubbo/${release_version}, and refer to step 6 to generate sha512 sign. Commit to Apache svn shell $ svn status $ svn commit -m 'prepare for ${release_version} RC1' Close the maven staging repository This step is required when prepare for a 2.7.0+ release, where package name has been changed to org.apache. Before that, please make sure all the maven artifacts look good. Login to http://repository.apache.org, click the Staging repositories on the left bar, search with keyword Dubbo, and you will see a list of repositories. Find the one you just uploaded, and then click the close button in the top area. This will do some sannity check, such as gpg signature check, and checksum check. After that, a link will be shown in the summary tab in the bottom. Please copy that link, it will be used for release vote. The link should look like this: https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/orgapachedubbo-1015. Please be aware that it may fail when you close the repository, this is normally due to network issues, please try again if it failed. You can confirm it by clicking the Activiey tab next to Summary . Verify Release Candidates A full check list can be found here The verification link includes but is not limited to the following contents and forms: Check signatures and hashes are good check the sha512 sum $ shasum -c apache-dubbo-${release_version}-source-release.zip.sha512 $ shasum -c apache-dubbo-${release_version}-bin-release.zip.sha512 check the gpg signarure If it's your first time verify a release candidte, you should import public keys first. $ curl https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/dubbo/KEYS KEYS # download public keys to local directory $ gpg --import KEYS # import keys $ gpg \u2014edit-key liujun trust # type trust command ``` Now, you can verify signature with command ```sh gpg --verify apache-dubbo-2.6.3-source-release.zip.asc apache-dubbo-2.6.3-source-release.zip gpg --verify apache-dubbo-2.6.3-bin-release.zip.asc apache-dubbo-2.6.3-bin-release.zip ``` ### Check source release file content Unzip apache-dubbo-${release_version}-source-release.zip to the default directory and check the following: - DISCLAIMER exists - LICENSE and NOTICE exists and contents are good - All files and no binary files exist - All files has standard ASF License header - Can compile from source - All unit tests can pass ```sh mvn clean test # This will run all unit tests # you can also open rat and style plugin to check if every file meets requirements. mvn clean test -Drat.skip=false -Dcheckstyle.skip=false ``` - Release candidates match with corresponding tags, you can find tag link and hash in vote email. - check the version number in pom.xml are the same - check there are no extra files or directories in the source package, for example, no empty directories or useless log files. `diff -r rc_dir tag_dir` - check the top n tag commits, dive into the related files and check if the source package has the same changes ### check third party dependencies According to ASF policy, any [Category X](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#what-can-we-not-include-in-an-asf-project-category-x) dependency can not be included in ASF product, this includes common LGPL/GPL licensed dependencies. Even transitive dependencies are not allowed. Therefore we need to run the following command to ensure no such dependencies are included. ```sh mvn license:add-third-party -Dlicense.useMissingFile find . -name THIRD-PARTY.txt | xargs grep -E 'GPL|General Public License' | grep -v Apache | grep -v MIT | grep -v CDDL If one dependency is dual/multiple licensed, just choose the most permissive one. Check binary distribution file content Unzip apache-dubbo-${release_version}-bin-release.zip and check: Check signatures are good LICENSE and NOTICE exists and contents are good Note that if the binary distribution contains third party files, you may need to update LICENSE file by adding the 3rd party license files. If these dependency is Apache License 2.0, and it contains NOTICE file, you may also need to update NOTICE file as well.

If you need, you can also consider placing a spring reference configuration in the API package, so that the user can only use the configuration in the spring loading process, and the configuration suggestion is placed in the package directory of the module, so as not to conflict, eg: com/alibaba/china/xxx/dubbo-reference.xml \u3002 Granularity The service interface should have large granularity as possible.Each service method should represent a function rather than a step of a function, otherwise it will be faced with distributed transaction problem. Dubbo does not provide distributed transaction support at present. The service interface recommends the division of the business scene as a unit and abstract the similar business to prevent the explosion of the number of interfaces. It is not recommended to use an too abstract universal interface, such as Map query (Map), which has no explicit semantics, which will inconvenience later maintenance. Version Each interface should define a version number to provide possible subsequent incompatible upgrades,eg: dubbo:service interface=\"com.xxx.XxxService\" version=\"1.0\" / \u3002 It is recommended to use a two bit version number, because the third - bit version number is usually compatible with a compatible upgrade, and a change of service version is required only when incompatible. When incompatible, half of the provider is upgraded to a new version, and all the consumers are upgraded to a new version, and the remaining half providers are upgraded to a new version. Compatibility The service interface adds method or the service model adds fields. It can be backward compatible, delete methods or delete fields, and will not be compatible. The new fields of the enumerated type are not compatible, so we need to upgrade by changing the version number. The compatibility of each protocol is different, see: Protocol introduction Enumeration type If it is a complete set, you can use Enum, eg: ENABLE , DISABLE \u3002 If it is the type of business, there will be an obvious type of increase in the future, and it is not recommended to use Enum , and it is not recommended to use Enum and can be replaced by String . If you use Enum in the return value,And add the Enum value,suggestions to upgrade the service consumption, so that the service provider does not return a new value. If the Enum value is used in the incoming parameter,and add the Enum value,it is suggested that the service provider be upgraded first, so that the service consumer will not pass the new value. Serialization The service parameters and return values suggest that the POJO object is used, that is, the object of the attribute is represented by the setter , getter method. Service parameters and return values do not recommend the use of interfaces, because data model abstraction is of little significance, and serialization requires interfaces to implement meta information of classes, and can not play the purpose of hiding implementation.

Because of its memory management, the change of Mina into netty greatly reduces the 1 version of the large memory sawtooth in high concurrency and large data. Performance comparison analysis (new and old environment, different data magnitude, etc.) The performance of Dubbo 2 is compared with that of Dubbo 1, which is all hessian2 serialization. The performance is improved (except for 50K String). See the performance data of the fifth chapter in detail. For compatibility default serialization and 1 consistent with hessian2, such as have higher requirements on the performance of Dubbo serialization can be used, which is in the process of complicated object, can be obtained in 50% large data upgrade (but it is not recommended for use Dubbo protocol). The purpose of Dubbo is to meet the RPC calls with high concurrent and small data volume. The performance is not good under large data volume. It is recommended to use RMI or HTTP protocol. Test limitation analysis (optional) This performance test examines the performance of the Dubbo itself, and the performance of the actual use needs to be verified. Because the performance of Dubbo itself is in millisecond and the base number is small, performance improvement may not change the performance of the application as a whole.

This article is lengthy since REST involves many aspects. Besides, it refers to the document style of Spring and so on. Not only limited to usage of the framework but also strives to present the design concept of the framework and the architectural idea of an excellent application.

How to Implement Load Balancing and Failover in Dubbo REST? Can Overloaded Methods in JAX-RS Map to Single URL? Can a Method in JAX-RS Receive Multiple Parameters Via POST? Possible shortcomings of Current Dubbo System (Related to REST) Invasiveness of Rpc Context Limitations of Protocol Configuration XML Naming Does Not Conform to the Convention of Spring REST Best Practices Performance Benchmark Test Environment Test Script Test Result Extended Discussion Comparison of REST, Thrift, Protobuf, etc. Comparison Between REST and Traditional Web Services Comparison Between JAX-RS and Spring MVC Future Overview Dubbo supports a variety of remote calling methods, such as Dubbo RPC (Binary Serialization + TCP), HTTP Invoker (Binary Serialization + HTTP, at least there is no support for Text Serialization in the open source version), Hessian (Binary Serialization + HTTP), Web Services (Text Serialization + HTTP), etc., but lacks support for trending RESTful Remote Calls (Text Serialization + HTTP). Therefore, based on the standard Java REST API: JAX-RS 2.0 (Abbreviation of Java API for RESTful Web Services), we provide a mostly transparent REST Call support for Dubbo. Since it is fully compatible with the Standard Java API, all REST services developed for Dubbo may normally work without Dubbo or any specific underlying REST implementation. It is particularly worth noting that we do not need to strictly adhere to the original definition and architectural style of REST. Even the famous Twitter REST API will make modest adjustments according to the situations, rather than mechanically follow the original REST style. Note: We call this feature RESTful Remoting (abstracted remote process or call) rather than a RESTful RPC (specific remote \"procedure\" call) because REST and RPC can be thought of two different styles. In Dubbo's REST implementation, there are two aspects, one is to provide or consume regular REST services, the other is to make REST a protocol implementation in the Dubbo RPC system, and RESTful Remoting covers both aspects. Advantages of REST The following is quoted from Wikipedia: REST can use cache to improve response speed more efficiently. The stateless nature of the communication allows a set of servers to handle different requests in series, resulting in the increment of server scalability. Browser can be used as a client to simplify software requirements. REST software dependency is smaller than other mechanisms superimposed on HTTP. REST does not require additional resource discovery mechanism. REST's long-term compatibility is better in software technology evolution. Here I also want to add a particular advantage of REST: REST bases on simple text format messages and universal HTTP. Therefore, it has a broad applicability and is supported by almost all languages and platforms, together with a lower threshold in using and learning. Application scenarios Because of the advantages of REST in applicability, supporting REST in Dubbo can bring (significant) benefits to most of current mainstream remoting call scenarios: Significantly simplify (cross-language) calls between heterogeneous systems within the enterprise. This is mainly for the following scene: Dubbo acts as a service provider, and systems that are written by other languages (including some java systems that do not base on Dubbo) works as service consumers. The two systems communicate through HTTP and text messages. REST has its unique advantages even comparing to binary cross-language RPC frameworks such as Thrift and ProtoBuf. (See discussion below) Significantly simplify the development of the external Open API (Open Platform). You can use Dubbo to develop a specific Open API application, or you can directly publish the internal Dubbo service as a \"transparent\" REST API (Of course, it's better for Dubbo itself to provide more features transparently, for example, permission control, frequency control, billing and so on). Significantly simplify the development of mobile (tablet) apps or desktop clients. Similar to point 2, you can use Dubbo to develop a specialized server for the applications, or transparently expose the internal Dubbo service. Of course in some projects, mobile or desktop applications can directly access the Open API described in point 2. Significantly simplify the development of AJAX applications on the browser. Similar to point 2, you can use Dubbo to develop a specialized server for AJAX, or transparently expose the internal Dubbo service directly to JavaScript in the browser. Of course, many AJAX applications work better with web frameworks, so direct access to the Dubbo service may not be an exquisite architecture in many web projects. Provide a text-based, easy-to-read remote call method for Dubbo systems within the enterprise (that is, both the service provider and the consumer are Dubbo-based systems). Simplify the call from the Dubbo system to other heterogeneous systems. You can use a simple way like Dubbo to \"transparently\" call REST services provided by Non-Dubbo systems (regardless of whether the service provider is inside or outside the enterprise) It should be pointed out that I think that 1~3 are the most valuable application scenarios for Dubbo's REST call. And the main purpose why we add REST calls for Dubbo is to provide a service-oriented provider. In other words, to develop REST services for Non-Dubbo (heterogeneous) consumers. To sum up, all application scenarios are shown below: Borrowing the most famous slogan of Java in the past, by adding REST calls to Dubbo, you can implement the \"Write once, access everywhere\" service, which can theoretically be accessed all over the world, thus truly achieving an idealized Service-oriented Architecture (SOA). Of course, traditional Web Services (WSDL/SOAP) can meet the requirements (even those that require enterprise-level features) of the above scenarios (except for scenario 4). But due to the complexity and other issues, they are less and less used. Quick Start Developing a RESTful service in Dubbo is relatively straightforward. Let's take a simple user registration service for example. The function to be implemented by this service is to provide the following URL (Note: This URL is not entirely RESTful, but more straightforward and more practical): http://localhost:8080/users/register Any client can POST a JSON string containing the user's information to the above URL to complete the user registration. First, implement the interface of the service: public class UserService { void registerUser(User user); } Then, implement the service: @Path( users ) public class UserServiceImpl implements UserService { @POST @Path( register ) @Consumes({MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON}) public void registerUser(User user) { // save the user... } } The above implementation code for the service is very simple, but since the REST service is to be published to a specific HTTP URL so they can be accessed by clients written by any language or even a browser, there are a few additional JAX-RS standard annotations to be added for the relevant configuration: @Path(\"users\"): Specify that the relative path for UserService is /users , standing for http://localhost:8080/users @Path(\"register\"): Specify that the relative path for registerUser() is /register . Combining the previous @Path specified for UserService , the URL to call UserService.register() is HTTP://localhost:8080/users/register @POST: Specify that registerUser() should be accessed with HTTP POST method @Consumes({MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON}): Specify that registerUser() receives data in JSON format. The REST framework will automatically deserialize JSON data into a User object. Finally, add this service to the spring configuration file and finish all service development work: ```xml ## Introduction to Standard Java REST API: JAX-RS JAX-RS is a standard Java REST API that has been widely supported and applied in the industry. There are many well-known open source implementations, including Oracle's Jersey, RedHat's RestEasy, Apache's CXF and Wink, restlet, etc. In addition, all commercial JavaEE application servers that support the JavaEE 6.0 specifications or above support JAX-RS. Therefore, JAX-RS is a very mature solution, and it does not have any so-called vendor lock-in problems. JAX-RS has a wealth of information on the web, such as the following introductory tutorial: * Oracle official tutorial: http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/doc/jaxrs.htm * Article on IBM developerWorks China: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cn/java/j-lo-jaxrs/ For more information, please feel free to Google or Baidu. As far as learning JAX-RS is concerned, it is generally enough to master the usage of various annotations. Note: Dubbo is based on the JAX-RS 2.0, and sometimes you need to pay attention to the version of the reference material or REST implementation. ## REST Service Provider Details In this section, we will expand the `UserService` in the Quick Start to further demonstrate the development points of the REST service provider in Dubbo. ### Implementation of HTTP POST/GET Although it's recommended to use the four standard methods (POST, DELETE, PUT and GET) in the HTTP protocol to implement common CRUD in REST services, but in practice, we generally use POST to implement create and update, and use GET to implement delete and read (DELETE and PUT will even be blocked by some firewalls). The implementation of POST has already been briefly demonstrated. Here, we will add a function to get the registered user data to `UserService`, in order to demonstrate the implementation of GET. This function is to enable the client to obtain user data of different IDs by accessing different URLs as follows: http://localhost:8080/users/1001 http://localhost:8080/users/1002 http://localhost:8080/users/1003 Of course, you can use other forms of URLs to access user data of different IDs, for example: http://localhost:8080/users/load?id=1001 JAX-RS itself can support all of these forms. However, the first form of including query parameters in the URL path (http://localhost:8080/users/1001) is more in line with the general habit of REST, so it is recommended to use. Below we will add a `getUser()` method to the `UserService` to implement this form of URL access: ```java @GET @Path( {id : \\\\d+} ) @Produces({MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON}) public User getUser(@PathParam( id ) Long id) { // ... } @GET: Specify that the method shoule be accessed with HTTP GET method @Path(\"{id : \\d+}\"): According to the above functional requirements, the URL to access getUser() should be \"http://localhost:8080/users/ + any number\", and this number should passed to getUser() method as parameter passed to the getUser() method. In the annotation here, the {id: xxx} in @Path specifies that the relative path contains the id parameter, and its value will be automatically passed to the method parameter id annotated with @PathParam(\"id\"). \\d+ following {id: is a regular expression specifies that the id parameter must be a number. @Produces({MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON}): Specify that getUser() outputs data in JSON format. The REST framework automatically serializes the User object into JSON data. Is annotation put in interface class or implementation class? The development of REST services based on Dubbo is mainly configured through JAX-RS annotations. In the above example, we put the annotation in the implementation class of the service. But in fact, we can completely put the annotation in the interface of the service. These two methods are completely equivalent, for example: @Path( users ) public interface UserService { @GET @Path( {id : \\\\d+} ) @Produces({MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON}) User getUser(@PathParam( id ) Long id); } In a typical application, we recommend put the annotation in the service implementation class. Then, annotations are closer to Java implementation code and easier to develop and maintain. More importantly, we generally tend to avoid contamination of the interface, maintaining the purity and wide applicability of the interface. However, as will be described later, if we access this service by using the consumer directly developed by Dubbo, the annotation must be put in the interface. If the interface and the implementation class are both added annotation at the same time, the implementation configuration of the implementation class will take effect, and the annotation on the interface will be ignored. Support for JSON, XML and other data formats The dubbo REST services can support the transmission of data in multiple formats to provide maximum flexibility to the client. And we add extra functions to the JSON and XML formats which is most commonly used. For example, we want the getUser() method in the above example support returning JSON and XML format data separately, just need to include two formats in the annotation: @Produces({MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON, MediaType.TEXT_XML}) User getUser(@PathParam( id ) Long id); Or you can directly represent a MediaType with a string (also supports wildcards): @Produces({ application/json , text/xml }) User getUser(@PathParam( id ) Long id); If all methods support the same type of input and output data format, then we do not need to make configure on each method, just add annotation to the service class: @Path( users ) @Consumes({MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON, MediaType.TEXT_XML}) @Produces({MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON, MediaType.TEXT_XML}) public class UserServiceImpl implements UserService { // ... } In the case where a REST service supports multiple data formats, according to the JAX-RS standard, the MIME header (content-type and accept) in HTTP is generally used to specify which format data is currently used. But in dubbo, we also automatically support the current common use of the industry, that is, use a URL suffix (.json and .xml) to specify the data format you want to use. For example, after adding the above annotation, directly accessing http://localhost:8888/users/1001.json means using the json format, and directly accessing http://localhost:8888/users/1002.xml means using the xml format. It's simpler and more intuitive than using HTTP Header. This way is used by the REST APIs of Twitter, Weibo, etc. If you don't add HTTP header or suffix, the REST of dubbo will give priority to enable the top ranked data format in the above definition of annotation. Note: To support XML format data, you can use either MediaType.TEXT_XML or MediaType.APPLICATION_XML in annotation, but TEXT_XML is more commonly used, and if you want to use the above URL suffix to specify the data format, you can only configure it as TEXT_XML to take effect. Chinese character support In order to output Chinese characters normally in dubbo REST, as with the usual Java web applications, we need to set the contentType of the HTTP response to UTF-8 encoding. Based on the standard usage of JAX-RS, we only need to do the following annotation configuration: @Produces({ application/json; charset=UTF-8 , text/xml; charset=UTF-8 }) User getUser(@PathParam( id ) Long id); For the convenience of users, we add a support class directly in dubbo REST to define the above constants, which can be used directly and reduce the possibility of error. @Produces({ContentType.APPLICATION_JSON_UTF_8, ContentType.TEXT_XML_UTF_8}) User getUser(@PathParam( id ) Long id); Additional requirements for XML data format Because the implementation of JAX-RS generally use standard JAXB (Java API for XML Binding) to serialize and deserialize XML format data, we need to add a class-level JAXB annotation for each object to be transferred in XML. Otherwise serialization will report an error. For example, add follows to the User returned in getUser() : @XmlRootElement public class User implements Serializable { // ... } In addition, if the return value in the service method is Java primitive type (such as int, long, float, double, etc.), it is best to add a wrapper object to them, because JAXB can not directly serialize the primitive type. For example, we want the above registerUser() method to return the ID number generated by the server for the user: long registerUser(User user); Because the primitive type is not supported by JAXB serialization, add a wrapper object: @XmlRootElement public class RegistrationResult implements Serializable { private Long id; public RegistrationResult() { } public RegistrationResult(Long id) { this.id = id; } public Long getId() { return id; } public void setId(Long id) { this.id = id; } } And modify the service method: RegistrationResult registerUser(User user); This not only solves the problem of XML serialization, but also makes the returned data conform to the specifications of XML and JSON. For example, in JSON, the returned form would be as follows: { id : 1001} If you do not add a wrapper, the JSON return value will be directly 1001 In XML, the return value after adding wrapper will be: registrationResult id 1002 /id /registrationResult This wrapper object actually uses the so-called Data Transfer Object (DTO) mode, and DTO can also make more useful customizations for transferring data. While in XML, after adding wrapper, the return value will be registrationResult id 1002 /id /registrationResult In fact, this wrapper object uses the so-called Data Transfer Object (DTO) mode. DTO can also be used to make more useful customizations to transfer data. Custom Serialization As mentioned above, the underlying implementation of REST will automatically serialize/deserialize between the service object and the JSON/XML data format. The REST implementation in Dubbo uses JAXB for XML serialization and Jackson for JSON serialization,so you can customize the mapping by adding JAXB or Jackson's annotation to the object. For example, customizing the object properties to map to the names of the XML elements: @XmlRootElement @XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD) public class User implements Serializable { @XmlElement(name= username ) private String name; } Customizing the object properties to map to the names of the JSON field: public class User implements Serializable { @JsonProperty( username ) private String name; } For more information, please refer to the official documentation of JAXB and Jackson, or google yourself. Configuring REST Server implementation Currently in dubbo, we support the implementation of five embedded rest servers. The implementation of the rest server is selected by the following XML attribute of the server: dubbo:protocol name= rest server= jetty / The above configuration uses the embedded jetty to do the rest server. At the same time, if you do not configure the server attribute, the rest protocol also uses jetty by default. jetty is a very mature java servlet container and has a good integration with dubbob (Among the five embedded servers, Only jetty and later tomcat\u3001tjws, complete seamless integration with Dubbo monitoring system.), so, if your dubbo system is a separate process, you can use jetty by default. dubbo:protocol name= rest server= tomcat / The above configuration uses the embedded tomcat to do the rest server.On embedded tomcat, REST performance is much better than jetty (See the benchmark below). It is recommended that Tomcat is used in scenarios where high performance is required. dubbo:protocol name= rest server= netty / The above configuration uses embedded netty to do the rest server. (TODO more contents to add) dubbo:protocol name= rest server= tjws / (tjws is now deprecated) dubbo:protocol name= rest server= sunhttp / The above configuration uses embedded tjws or Sun HTTP server to do the rest server. These two server implementations are very lightweight, it is very convenient for quick start-up in integration testing, of course, it can also be used in a production environment with low load. Note: tjws is currently deprecated because it does not work well with the servlet 3.1 API. If your dubbo system is not a separate process, instead of deploying to a Java application server, we recommend the following configuration: dubbo:protocol name= rest server= servlet / By setting the server as the servlet, dubbo will use the servlet container of the external application server to do the rest server. At the same time, add the following configuration to the web.xml of the dubbo system: web-app context-param param-name contextConfigLocation /param-name param-value /WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/spring/dubbo-demo-provider.xml /param-value /context-param listener listener-class org.apache.dubbo.remoting.http.servlet.BootstrapListener /listener-class /listener listener listener-class org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener /listener-class /listener servlet servlet-name dispatcher /servlet-name servlet-class org.apache.dubbo.remoting.http.servlet.DispatcherServlet /servlet-class load-on-startup 1 /load-on-startup /servlet servlet-mapping servlet-name dispatcher /servlet-name url-pattern /* /url-pattern /servlet-mapping /web-app In other words, you must add dubbo's BootstrapListener and DispatherServlet to web.xml to complete the integration of dubbo's REST functionality with the external servlet container. Note:If you are using spring's ContextLoaderListener to load spring, you must ensure that the BootstrapListener is configured before the ContextLoaderListener, otherwise the dubbo initialization will fail. In fact, you can still stick to the embedded server in this scenario, but the servlet container of the external application server is often more powerful than the embedded server(Especially if you are deploying to a more robust and scalable WebLogic, WebSphere, etc.). In addition, it is sometimes convenient to do unified management, monitoring, and so on in the application server. Get Context Information Varieties of context information are valuable when calling procedures remotely. For instance, the IP address from the Client. We provide two methods to get the Client's IP in dubbo. The first one is using @Context annotation from JAX-RS: public User getUser(@PathParam( id ) Long id, @Context HttpServletRequest request) { System.out.println( Client address is + request.getRemoteAddr()); } After decorating a parameter of getUser() with Context, we can inject the current HttpServletRequest and then call the servlet api to get the IP. Notice: This method can only be used when the server is one of the followings: twjs, tomecat, jetty or servlet. All of them provide servlet container. In addition, standard JAX-RS also allow us to get HttpServletRequest using an instance field in service Class decorated by @Context . The second method is to use RpcContext, which is commonly seen in dubbo: public User getUser(@PathParam( id ) Long id) { System.out.println( Client address is + RpcContext.getContext().getRemoteAddressString()); } Notice: Similarly, this method only works in the jetty, tomcat, servlet or tjws server. In dubbo, the usage of RpcContext is rather invasive. We are likely to refactor it in the future. The first method is suggested when your project may run without dubbo and need the compatibility with JAX-RS. But if you want a more elegant service interface definition, the second method would be the better choice. What's more, in the newest version of dubbo REST service, RpcContext could be used to get HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse, providing great flexibility for users to implement some complex functions. The following is an example: if (RpcContext.getContext().getRequest() != null RpcContext.getContext().getRequest() instanceof HttpServletRequest) { System.out.println( Client address is + ((HttpServletRequest) RpcContext.getContext().getRequest()).getRemoteAddr()); } if (RpcContext.getContext().getResponse() != null RpcContext.getContext().getResponse() instanceof HttpServletResponse) { System.out.println( Response object from RpcContext: + RpcContext.getContext().getResponse()); } Notice: In order to maintain the neutrality of the protocol, RpcContext.getRequest() and RpcContext.getResponse() only return an Object which could be null. Therefore, you have to check the type on your own. Notice: only when you use jetty, tomcat, servlet as the server can you get the HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse as expected. Because only these server implemented the servlet container. To simplify the programme, you can also use generic to get a specific type of request/response: if (RpcContext.getContext().getRequest(HttpServletRequest.class) != null) { System.out.println( Client address is + RpcContext.getContext().getRequest(HttpServletRequest.class).getRemoteAddr()); } if (RpcContext.getContext().getResponse(HttpServletResponse.class) != null) { System.out.println( Response object from RpcContext: + RpcContext.getContext().getResponse(HttpServletResponse.class)); } If request/response does not correspond to the specific type, it would return null. Configure The Port Number and Context Path The REST protocol in dubbo use 80 as the default port. But you are also allowed to modify it: dubbo:protocol name= rest port= 8888 / As what have been metioned before, we can use @Path to configure relative URL path in single REST service. In fact, we can also set a basic relative path which is known as context path for all REST service. All we need to do is to add the contextpath property: dubbo:protocol name= rest port= 8888 contextpath= services / Let's have a look at the previous code: @Path( users ) public class UserServiceImpl implements UserService { @POST @Path( register ) @Consumes({MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON}) public void registerUser(User user) { // save the user... } } Now the complete path would be: http://localhost:8888/services/users/register Notice: If you use external server as REST server, you should configure as followings, dubbo:protocol name= rest port= 8888 contextpath= services server= servlet / meaning that you should keep the config of port and contextpath are the same with the port and DispatcherServlet's context path (webapp path + servlet url pattern) in external server. For example, when we are configuring the application on tomcat Root path, we need to make sure the contextpath here is totally the same with the url-pattern/ of DispacherServlet in web.xml: servlet-mapping servlet-name dispatcher /servlet-name url-pattern /services/* /url-pattern /servlet-mapping Configure the number of threads and IO threads We can set the number of threads of rest service: dubbo:protocol name= rest threads= 500 / Notice: Currently, the setting only works when the server is netty, jetty or tomcat. If you use servlet as the server, you are using the external server as the REST server which is out of dubboes' control, so the setting would not work expectedly. You can also set threads number of IO worker of netty server: dubbo:protocol name= rest iothreads= 5 threads= 100 / Configure long connections The REST service in Dubbo is accessed by default with http long connection, if you want to switch to short connection, you can configure it as below: dubbo:protocol name= rest keepalive= false / Notice: This configuration only works in netty and tomcat. Configure the maximum number of HTTP connections Configuring the maximum number of HTTP connections can prevent REST server from overload as the basic self-protection mechanism. dubbo:protocol name= rest accepts= 500 server= tomcat/ Notice: Currently, it only works in tomcat. Configuring the timeout and HTTP connections for each consumer If the consumer of the rest service is also a dubbo system, you can configure the maximum timeout for the consumer to call the rest service, and the maximum number of HTTP connections that each consumer can initiate, just like other dubbo RPC mechanisms. dubbo:service interface= xxx ref= xxx protocol= rest timeout= 2000 connections= 10 / Of course, since this configuration is valid for the consumer, it can also be configured on the consumer side: dubbo:reference id= xxx interface= xxx timeout= 2000 connections= 10 / However, we generally recommend configuring the service provider to provide such a configuration. According to the official dubbo documentation, \u201cProvider should configure the properties of the Consumer side as much as possible. Let the Provider implementer think about the service features and service quality of the Provider from the beginning.\u201d Note: If dubbo REST service is released to non-dubbo clients, the configuration on dubbo:service/ is completely invalid because the client is not under dubbo control. GZIP data compresssion Dubbo RESTful Remoting supports the use of Gzip to compress request and response data to reduce network transmission time and bandwidth consumption, but this will also increase CPU overhead. TODO more contents to add. Replacing part of the spring XML configuration with annotation Above discussions are based on the XML configuration of Dubbo in spring. However, dubbo/spring itself supports the use of annotation for configuration, so we can also follow the steps in the Dubbo document and add the relevant annotation to the REST service implementation, replacing some XML configurations, such as: @Service(protocol = rest ) @Path( users ) public class UserServiceImpl implements UserService { @Autowired private UserRepository userRepository; @POST @Path( register ) @Consumes({MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON}) public void registerUser(User user) { // save the user userRepository.save(user); } } Annotation-based configuration is more concise and precise, and often easier to maintain (modern IDE can support such things as class name refactoring in XML, and therefore the maintenance of XML is good for specific use cases here). XML is less intrusive to code, especially for dynamically modifying configurations, especially when you want to modify the timeout for connection of a single service configuration, the maximum number of connections per client, cluster policy, weights, and so on. In addition, for complex applications or modules, XML provides a central point to cover all the components and configurations. It is at a glance, and generally more convenient for long term maintenance of the project. Of course, there's no right or wrong of different choices of configuration method. Sometimes it's just personal preference. Adding a custom Filter, Interceptor, etc Dubbo RESTful Remoting also supports JAX-RS standard Filter and Interceptor to facilitate customized interception of REST request and response processes. Here, Filter is mainly used to access and set parameters, URIs for HTTP request and response, and so on, for example, setting the cache header for HTTP response: public class CacheControlFilter implements ContainerResponseFilter { public void filter(ContainerRequestContext req, ContainerResponseContext res) { if (req.getMethod().equals( GET )) { res.getHeaders().add( Cache-Control , someValue ); } } } Interceptor is mainly used to access and modify the input and output byte streams, for example, manually adding GZIP compression: public class GZIPWriterInterceptor implements WriterInterceptor { @Override public void aroundWriteTo(WriterInterceptorContext context) throws IOException, WebApplicationException { OutputStream outputStream = context.getOutputStream(); context.setOutputStream(new GZIPOutputStream(outputStream)); context.proceed(); } } In standard JAX-RS applications, we generally add @Provider annotations to Filter and Interceptor, and JAX-RS runtime will automatically discover and enable them. In Dubbo, we register Filter and Interceptor by adding an XML configuration: dubbo:protocol name= rest port= 8888 extension= xxx.TraceInterceptor, xxx.TraceFilter / Here, we can add these three types of objects, Filter, Interceptor and DynamicFeature, to the extension attributes, separated by commas. (DynamicFeature is another interface that allows us to enable Filter and Interceptor more dynamically. Please feel free to google.) Of course, Dubbo itself also supports Filter, but the Filter and Interceptor we discuss here are more like the bottom of the protocol implementation. Compared to Dubbo's filter, you can do a lower level of customization here. Note: The XML attribute here is called extension, not interceptor or filter. That is because we will add more extension types in addition to Interceptor and Filter in the future. If the REST consumer is also a Dubbo system (see discussion below), you can also configure the Interceptor and Filter for the consumer in a similar way. However, it should be noted that the consumer-side Filter and the provider-side Filter in JAX-RS are two different interfaces. For example, in the previous example, the server is the ContainerResponseFilter interface, and the consumer side corresponds to the ClientResponseFilter: public class LoggingFilter implements ClientResponseFilter { public void filter(ClientRequestContext reqCtx, ClientResponseContext resCtx) throws IOException { System.out.println( status: + resCtx.getStatus()); System.out.println( date: + resCtx.getDate()); System.out.println( last-modified: + resCtx.getLastModified()); System.out.println( location: + resCtx.getLocation()); System.out.println( headers: ); for (Entry String, List String header : resCtx.getHeaders().entrySet()) { System.out.print( \\t + header.getKey() + : ); for (String value : header.getValue()) { System.out.print(value + , ); } System.out.print( \\n ); } System.out.println( media-type: + resCtx.getMediaType().getType()); } } Adding custom Exception handler Dubbo RESTful Remoting also supports JAX-RS standard ExceptionMapper, which can be used to customize the HTTP response after a particular exception occurs. public class CustomExceptionMapper implements ExceptionMapper NotFoundException { public Response toResponse(NotFoundException e) { return Response.status(Response.Status.NOT_FOUND).entity( Oops! the requested resource is not found! ).type( text/plain ).build(); } } Similar to Interceptor and Filter, it can be enabled by adding it to an XML configuration file: dubbo:protocol name= rest port= 8888 extension= xxx.CustomExceptiionMapper / Configuring HTTP log output Dubbo RESTful Remoting supports outputting the header and body in all HTTP requests/responses. Add the following REST filter to the XML configuration: dubbo:protocol name= rest port= 8888 extension= org.apache.dubbo.rpc.protocol.rest.support.LoggingFilter / Then turn on at least INFO level log output for org.apache.dubbo.rpc.protocol.rest.support in the logging configuration ,for example,in log4j.xml: logger name= org.apache.dubbo.rpc.protocol.rest.support level value= INFO / appender-ref ref= CONSOLE / /logger Of course, you can also turn on INFO level log output directly in the ROOT logger: root level value= INFO / appender-ref ref= CONSOLE / /root Then there will be something like the following output in the log: The HTTP headers are: accept: application/json;charset=UTF-8 accept-encoding: gzip, deflate connection: Keep-Alive content-length: 22 content-type: application/json host: 192.168.1.100:8888 user-agent: Apache-HttpClient/4.2.1 (java 1.5) The contents of request body is: { id :1, name : dang } After the HTTP log output is turned on, in addition to the performance overhead of the normal log output, additional overhead is generated in, for example, HTTP request parsing, because an additional memory buffer needs to be allocated to prepare the data for the log output. Inputing parameter validation Dubbo RESTful Remoting supports the use of the Java standard bean validation annotation(JSR 303) for input validation http://beanvalidation.org/. In order to be consistent with other Dubbo remote invocation protocols, the annotations that are checked for rest must be placed on the interface of the service, for example: public interface UserService { User getUser(@Min(value=1L, message= User ID must be greater than 1 ) Long id); } Of course, in many other bean validation scenarios, annotations are placed on implementation classes rather than interfaces. At least one advantage of placing an annotation on an interface is that the Dubbo client can share information about the interface. The input validation can be done locally even without RPC. Then turn on the validation in the XML configuration in the same way as Dubbo: dubbo:service interface=xxx.UserService ref= userService protocol= rest validation= true / In many other RPC protocols of Dubbo, if the input validation error occurs, the RpcException is directly thrown to the client, but in the rest, since the client is often non-Dubbo or even non-Java system, it is inconvenient to directly throw a Java exception. Therefore, at present we will return the validation error in XML format: violationReport constraintViolations path getUserArgument0 /path message User ID must be greater than 1 /message value 0 /value /constraintViolations /violationReport The return values of other data formats will also be supported later. As for how to internationalize the verification error message, refer directly to the relevant documentation of the bean validation. If you think that the default validation error return format does not meet your requirements, you can add custom ExceptionMapper to custom error return format freely as described in the previous section. It should be noted that this ExceptionMapper must use the generic declaration to capture the RpcException of Dubbo in order to successfully override the default exception handling strategy of Dubbo rest. In order to simplify the operation, the easiest way to do this is to directly inherit the RpcExceptionMapper of Dubbo rest and override the method that handles the validation exception: public class MyValidationExceptionMapper extends RpcExceptionMapper { protected Response handleConstraintViolationException(ConstraintViolationException cve) { ViolationReport report = new ViolationReport(); for (ConstraintViolation cv : cve.getConstraintViolations()) { report.addConstraintViolation(new RestConstraintViolation( cv.getPropertyPath().toString(), cv.getMessage(), cv.getInvalidValue() == null ? null : cv.getInvalidValue().toString())); } // Use json output instead of xml output return Response.status(Response.Status.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR).entity(report).type(ContentType.APPLICATION_JSON_UTF_8).build(); } } Then add this ExceptionMapper to the XML configuration: dubbo:protocol name= rest port= 8888 extension= xxx.MyValidationExceptionMapper / Whether to transparently publish REST service Dubbo RESTful Remoting differs from some other RPCs in Dubbo in that you need to add JAX-RS annotations (and JAXB, Jackson's annotation) to your service code. If you think these annotations \"pollute\" your service code to a certain extent,you can consider writing additional Facade and DTO classes, adding annotations to that, and Facade forwards the calls to the real service implementation class. Of course, adding annotations directly to the service code basically has no negative effects, and this is itself a standard usage in Java EE. In addition, JAX-RS and JAXB annotations belong to the Java standard. Compared with spring, Dubbo, etc., which we often use, annotations have no problem with vendor lock-in, so there is usually no need to introduce additional objects. In addition,when you want to use the @Context annotation mentioned above, injecting HttpServletRequest through method parameters (such as public User getUser(@PathParam(\"id\") Long id, @Context HttpServletRequest request) ), the method signature of service is changed and HttpServletRequest is a REST-specific parameter, you should introduce additional Facade classes if your service supports multiple RPC mechanisms. Of course, your service code may already act as a Facade and DTO before adding RESTful Remoting (as to why some scenarios require these roles, and if you are interested, you can refer to [Micro-SOA: Service Design Principles and Practices] Http://www.infoq.com/cn/articles/micro-soa-1). In this case, after adding REST, if you add additional REST-related Facade and DTO, it is equivalent to wrapping the original code again, which forms the following call chain: RestFacade/RestDTO - Facade/DTO - Service This kind of system is cumbersome, and the workload of data conversion is not small, so it should be avoided if possible. Consumer of RESTful Remoting Here we use three scenarios: The non-Dubbo consumer calls Dubbo REST service (non-Dubbo -- Dubbo) The Dubbo consumer calls Dubbo REST service (Dubbo -- Dubbo) The consumer of Dubbo calls the non-Dubbo REST service (Dubbo -- non-Dubbo) Scenario 1: Non-Dubbo consumer calls Dubbo REST Service The client of this scenario has nothing to do with Dubbo itself, and it can be directly selected in the appropriate language and framework. If it is still a Java client (but not using Dubbo), consider using the standard JAX-RS Client API or a specific REST-implemented Client API to invoke the REST service. The following is the registerUser() that uses the JAX-RS Client API to access the above UserService: User user = new User(); user.setName( Larry ); Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient(); WebTarget target = client.target( http://localhost:8080/services/users/register.json ); Response response = target.request().post(Entity.entity(user, MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_TYPE)); try { if (response.getStatus() != 200) { throw new RuntimeException( Failed with HTTP error code : + response.getStatus()); } System.out.println( The generated id is + response.readEntity(RegistrationResult.class).getId()); } finally { response.close(); client.close(); //Do not close the client every time in real development, such as HTTP long connection is held by the client } The User and RegistrationResult classes in the code snippet above are written by the consumer itself, and the JAX-RS Client API automatically serializes/deserializes them. Of course, in Java, you can also use the familiar technologies such as HttpClient, FastJson, XStream, etc. to implement the REST client, which will not be detailed here. Scenario 2: Dubbo consumer calls Dubbo RESTful Remoting In this scenario, same as other Dubbo remote calling methods, the Java service interface is shared directly between the service provider and the service consumer, and the Spring XML configuration is added (of course, the Spring/Dubbo annotation configuration can also be used),the remote REST service can be called transparently: dubbo:reference id= userService interface= xxx.UserService / As mentioned earlier, in this scenario, JAX-RS annotations must be added to the service interface, so that the corresponding REST configuration information can be shared on the consumer side of Dubbo and remotely called accordingly: @Path( users ) public interface UserService { @GET @Path( {id : \\\\d+} ) @Produces({MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON, MediaType.APPLICATION_XML}) User getUser(@PathParam( id ) Long id); } If a variety of data formats are configured in the annotation of the service interface, since both ends are Dubbo systems, a lot of details of REST are blocked, so there is no possibility to select a data format using the aforementioned URL suffix. Currently in this case, the top ranked data format will be used directly. Therefore, we recommend that you put the most appropriate data format in front of defining an annotation. For example, we put JSON in front of XML because JSON's transmission performance is better than XML. Scenario 3: The consumer of Dubbo calls a non-Dubbo RESTful Remoting In this scenario, the REST service can be called directly using the Java method described in Scenario 1. But in fact, you can also use the way described in Scenario 2, that is, calling the REST service more transparently, even if this service is not provided by Dubbo. If the scenario 2 is used, since the REST service is not provided by Dubbo, there is generally no shared Java service interface mentioned above, so we need to write the Java interface and the corresponding parameter class according to the external REST service. Add JAX-RS, JAXB, Jackson and other annotations, Dubbo's REST underlying implementation will automatically generate request messages, automatically parse response messages, etc., so as to transparently make remote calls. Or this way can also be understood as, we try to use JAX-RS to copy the implementation of the external REST service provider, and then put the written service interface to the client to use directly, Dubbo REST underlying implementation can call other REST services as it calls Dubbo's REST service . For example, we want to call the following external service. http://api.foo.com/services/users/1001 http://api.foo.com/services/users/1002 Get user data of different IDs, the return format is JSON { id : 1001, name : Larry } We can write service interfaces and parameter classes based on this information: @Path( users ) public interface UserService { @GET @Path( {id : \\\\d+} ) @Produces({MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON}) User getUser(@PathParam( id ) Long id); } public class User implements Serializable { private Long id; private String name; // \u2026 } For the configuration in Spring, because the REST service is not provided by Dubbo, you can not use the Dubbo registry to directly configure the url address of the external REST service (such as multiple addresses separated by commas): dubbo:reference id= userService interface= xxx.UserService url= rest://api.foo.com/services/ / Note: The protocol here must use rest:// instead of http://. If the external REST service has a context path, it must also be added to the url (unless you have a context path in the @Path annotation for each service interface), such as /services/ above. At the same time, the services here must be followed by /, in order to make Dubbo work properly. In addition, you can still configure the maximum number of connections and timeouts that the client can start: dubbo:reference id= userService interface= xxx.UserService url= rest://api.foo.com/services/ timeout= 2000 connections= 10 / JAX-RS restrictions in Dubbo The REST development in Dubbo is fully compatible with standard JAX-RS, but the features it supports are currently a subset of full JAX-RS, in part because it is limited to the specific architecture of Dubbo and Spring. The limitations of JAX-RS used in Dubbo include but are not limited to: Service implementation can only be singleton, and it can not support per-request scope and per-lookup scope It is not supported to inject into ServletConfig, ServletContext, HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse, etc. with the @Context annotation for the instance field of the service, but it can support the injection of service method parameters. However, for certain REST server implementations (see the previous section), injection of service method parameters is not supported. REST FAQ Can Dubbo REST services be integrated with Dubbo Registry and Monitor? Yes, and it will integrate automatically. That is, all the REST services you develop in Dubbo are automatically registered to the Registry and Monitor, by which you can managed your services. However, many of the service governance operations in the Registry can only be fully functional when the REST consumer is based on Dubbo. If the consumer side is non-Dubbo, it is naturally not managed by the Registry, so that many of the operations will not work for the consumer. How to implement load balancing and failover in Dubbo REST? If the consumer side of Dubbo REST is based on Dubbo, then Dubbo REST is basically the same as other Dubbo remote call protocols: Dubbo framework transparently performs load balancing, failover, etc. on the consumer side. If the consumer side of Dubbo REST is non-Dubbo or even non-Java, it is better to configure the soft load balancing mechanism on the service provider. Currently, you can consider LVS, HAProxy, Nginx, and so on to achieve load balancing for HTTP requests. Can overloaded method in JAX-RS maps to the same URL address? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17196766/can-resteasy-choose-method-based-on-query-params Can a POST method in JAX-RS receive multiple parameters? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5553218/jax-rs-post-multiple-objects The shortcomings of Dubbo's current system (related to REST) I think there are obviously a lot of deficiencies in Dubbo's current system. Here are a few REST-related issues that affect users (not including internal implementation issues) for reference and comments, which can help prepare for the refactoring later. Invasiveness of RpcContext We have already mentioned the intrusiveness of RpcContext(See above). Because it uses a singleton to access context information, which is completely inconsistent with the general style of spring applications as well as not conducive to application extension and unit testing. In the future, we may inject an interface with dependency injection, and then use it to access the context information in ThreadLocal. limitations of Protocol configuration Dubbo supports multiple remote call methods, but all call methods are configured with , for example: Dubbo:protocol name= Dubbo port= 9090 server= netty client= netty codec= Dubbo serialization= hessian2 charset= UTF-8 threadpool= fixed threads= 100 queues= 0 iothreads= 9 buffer= 8192 accepts= 1000 payload= 8388608 / Dubbo supports multiple remote call methods, but all call methods are configured with , for example: In fact, many of the above properties are uniquely held by the Dubbo RPC remote call method and many other remote call methods in Dubbo do not support server, client, codec, iothreads, accepts, payload, etc. (of course, some are not supported because of limited conditions, some have no need to be supported at all). This adds a lot of confusions to users when they use Dubbo, and they actually do not know that some attributes (such as performance tuning) will not work after adding them. On the other hand, various remote call methods often have a large number of unique configuration requirements, especially as we gradually add much richer and more advanced functions to each kind of remote call method, which cause the expands in attributes inevitably (for example, we have added keepalive and extension two attributes in REST at the moment) and then lead to bloated and user confusion. Of course, there is a way to expand in Dubbo by using , but this method is obviously very limited, the usage is complicated and the schema verification is lacking. So that the best method is to set your own protocol elements for each remote call, such as , , etc. Each element specifies its own attributes using XML Schema. (Of course, it is best to use common attributes between a variety of remote call methods) In this way, a freer way can be used when doing the extension configuration mentioned above, so that it can be much clearer and more extensible (the following is just an example, of course there may be a better way): Dubbo:protocol-rest port= 8080 Dubbo:extension someInterceptor /Dubbo:extension Dubbo:extension someFilter /Dubbo:extension Dubbo:extension someDynamicFeature /Dubbo:extension Dubbo:extension someEntityProvider /Dubbo:extension /Dubbo:protocol-rest XML naming does not conform to the spring specification A lot of naming in XML configuration of Dubbo dose not conform to the spring specification, such as: Dubbo:protocol name= Dubbo port= 9090 server= netty client= netty codec= Dubbo serialization= hessian2 charset= UTF-8 threadpool= fixed threads= 100 queues= 0 iothreads= 9 buffer= 8192 accepts= 1000 payload= 8388608 / The above threadpool should be changed to thread-pool, iothreads should be changed to io-threads, and words should be separated by \"-\". While this may seem like a minor issue, it also involves readability, especially scalability, because sometimes we will inevitably use more words to describe XML elements and attributes. In fact, Dubbo itself also recommended to follow the naming convention of spring to XML. Best practices of REST TODO Performance benchmark Test Environment Roughly as follows: 4-core Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2603 0 @ 1.80GHz 8G memory The network between servers passes through a 100 Mbps switch CentOS 5 JDK 7 Tomcat 7 JVM parameter -server -Xms1g -Xmx1g -XX:PermSize=64M -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC Test Script Similar to Dubbo's own benchmarks: 10 concurrent clients send requests continuously: \u2022 Pass in nested complex objects (single data is small), do nothing and return \u2022 Pass in a 50K string, do nothing and return (TODO: the result is not listed yet) Excute a five-minute performance test. (Reference to Dubbo's own test considerations: \"Mainly consider the serialization and performance of network IO, so that the server side does not have any business logic. Take 10 to run simultaneously because of the consideration that the bottleneck can be hit first when the high CPU usage rate is reached by HTTP protocol under the high concurrency situation.\") Test Result The following results are mainly from the comparison between to the two remote call methods, REST and Dubbo RPC which are configured differently, for example: \u201cREST: Jetty + XML + GZIP\u201d means: Test REST, use jetty server and XML data format, and enable GZIP compression. \u201cDubbo: hessian2\u201d means: test Dubbo RPC and use hessian2 serialization. The results for complex objects are as follows (the smaller Response Time and the larger TPS, the better results): Remote Call Mode Average Response Time Average TPS\uff08Num of transactions per second\uff09 REST: Jetty + JSON 7.806 1280 REST: Jetty + JSON + GZIP TODO TODO REST: Jetty + XML TODO TODO REST: Jetty + XML + GZIP TODO TODO REST: Tomcat + JSON 2.082 4796 REST: Netty + JSON 2.182 4576 Dubbo: FST 1.211 8244 Dubbo: kyro 1.182 8444 Dubbo: Dubbo serialization 1.43 6982 Dubbo: hessian2 1.49 6701 Dubbo: fastjson 1.572 6352 Just a brief summary of the current results: Dubbo RPC (especially when based on efficient java serialization methods such as kryo and fst) has a significant advantage response time and throughput over REST. Dubbo RPC is preferred in the intranet Dubbo systems. When choosinf REST implementation, tomcat7 and netty are optimal (of course, the current versions of jetty and netty are lower) currently only considering performance. Tjws and sun http server performed extremely poorly in performance tests, with an average response time of more than 200ms and an average tps of only about 50 (to avoid affecting the picture effect, the results are not listed above). Performance of JSON data format is better than XML in REST (data is not listed above). Enabling GZIP in REST has little to do with complex objects with small data volume in the intranet, but performance has declined (data is not listed above). Performance Optimization Recommendations If you deploy Dubbo REST to an external Tomcat and configure server=\"servlet\", that is, enable external tomcat as the underlying implementation of rest server, it is best to add the following configuration to tomcat: Connector port= 8080 protocol= org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol connectionTimeout= 20000 redirectPort= 8443 minSpareThreads= 20 enableLookups= false maxThreads= 100 maxKeepAliveRequests= -1 keepAliveTimeout= 60000 / Especially the configuration maxKeepAliveRequests=\"-1\" ,which is mainly to ensure that tomcat always enables http long connection, in order to improve the performance of REST call. Note, however, that if the REST consumer side is not continuously call REST services, it is not always best to enable long connections all time. In addition, the way to always enable long connections is generally not suitable for ordinary webapps, but more suitable for such rpc-like scenarios. So that in order to get high performance, Dubbo REST applications and ordinary web applications are best not to be mixed deployment, but should use a separate instance in tomcat. Extended discussion Comparison among Rest, Thrift, Protobuf and so on TODO Comparison between REST and traditional Webservers TODO Comparison of JAX-RS Between Spring MVC A preliminary view from http://www.infoq.com/cn/news/2014/10/Dubbox-open-source?utm_source=infoq utm_medium=popular_links_homepage#theCommentsSection Thank you, in fact, for jax-rs and Spring MVC, I do not have a deep look at the rest support of Spring MVC. I would like to give you some preliminary ideas. Please correct me: Spring MVC also supports configuration using annotation, which actually looks very similar to jax-rs. Personally, I think Spring MVC is better suited to restful services of web applications, such as being invoked by AJAX, or possibly outputting HTML or something like page jump processes in applications. Spring MVC can handle both normal web page requests and rest requests at the same time. But in general, the restful service is implemented in the presentation layer or the web layer. But Jax-rs is more suitable for pure service-oriented applications, that is, the middle-tier services in traditional Java EE, for example, it can publish traditional EJB as restful services. In a Spring application, the bean that acts as a service in the Spring is directly published as a restful service. In general, the restful service is at the business layer, application layer, or facade layer. And MVC hierarchies and concepts are often of little value in such (back-end) applications. Of course, some implementations of jax-rs, such as jersey, also try to include MVC to better accommodate the web applications described above, but not as well as Spring MVC. In Dubbo applications, I think a lot of people prefer to publish a local Spring service bean (or manager) as a remote service directly and transparently, so that it is more straightforward to use JAX-RS here, and there is no need to introduce the MVC concept. Of course, we do not discuss whether transparent publishing of remote services is a best practice or whether to add facade things here first. Of course, I know that many people use Spring MVC restful to call Dubbo (spring) service to publish restful services under the situation that Dubbo does not support rest now. It\u2019s a good method also in my opinion, but if you do not modify Spring MVC and integrate it deeply with Dubbo, restful services cannot enjoy many advanced services such as registering to the Dubbo Registry, monitoring the number of calls, TPS, response time through the Dubbo Monitor, controlling the size of the thread pool and the maximum number of connections through the unified configuration of Dubbo, and controlling the service flow, authority and frequency through Dubbo unified mode like other remote call protocol such as webservices, Dubbo rpc, hessian and so on in Dubbo system. In addition, Spring MVC only works in server side and Spring restTemplate are usually used on consumer side. If restTemplate is not integrated with Dubbo, the service can be downgraded by Dubbo client automatically or manually. If the server and consumer are all Dubbo system, you cannot use unified routing and other functions in Dubbo if the Spring rest is not deeply integrated into Dubbo through interaction of Spring and rest. Of course, I personally think that these things are not necessarily to be one or the other. I heard that Rod Johnson, the founder of spring usually says \u2018the customer is always right,\u2019 In fact, it is better to support both ways at the same time rather than discuss which way is better, so that originally I wrote in the document that we plan to support Spring rest annotation, but the feasibility is unknown.

Therefore, based on the standard Java REST API: JAX-RS 2.0 (Abbreviation of Java API for RESTful Web Services), we provide a mostly transparent REST Call support for Dubbo. Since it is fully compatible with the Standard Java API, all REST services developed for Dubbo may normally work without Dubbo or any specific underlying REST implementation. It is particularly worth noting that we do not need to strictly adhere to the original definition and architectural style of REST. Even the famous Twitter REST API will make modest adjustments according to the situations, rather than mechanically follow the original REST style. Note: We call this feature RESTful Remoting (abstracted remote process or call) rather than a RESTful RPC (specific remote \"procedure\" call) because REST and RPC can be thought of two different styles. In Dubbo's REST implementation, there are two aspects, one is to provide or consume regular REST services, the other is to make REST a protocol implementation in the Dubbo RPC system, and RESTful Remoting covers both aspects.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"user/rest/#advantages-of-rest","text":"The following is quoted from Wikipedia: REST can use cache to improve response speed more efficiently.

REST does not require additional resource discovery mechanism. REST's long-term compatibility is better in software technology evolution.

Therefore, it has a broad applicability and is supported by almost all languages and platforms, together with a lower threshold in using and learning.","title":"Advantages of REST"},{"location":"user/rest/#application-scenarios","text":"Because of the advantages of REST in applicability, supporting REST in Dubbo can bring (significant) benefits to most of current mainstream remoting call scenarios: Significantly simplify (cross-language) calls between heterogeneous systems within the enterprise. This is mainly for the following scene: Dubbo acts as a service provider, and systems that are written by other languages (including some java systems that do not base on Dubbo) works as service consumers. The two systems communicate through HTTP and text messages. REST has its unique advantages even comparing to binary cross-language RPC frameworks such as Thrift and ProtoBuf. (See discussion below) Significantly simplify the development of the external Open API (Open Platform). You can use Dubbo to develop a specific Open API application, or you can directly publish the internal Dubbo service as a \"transparent\" REST API (Of course, it's better for Dubbo itself to provide more features transparently, for example, permission control, frequency control, billing and so on). Significantly simplify the development of mobile (tablet) apps or desktop clients. Similar to point 2, you can use Dubbo to develop a specialized server for the applications, or transparently expose the internal Dubbo service. Of course in some projects, mobile or desktop applications can directly access the Open API described in point 2. Significantly simplify the development of AJAX applications on the browser. Similar to point 2, you can use Dubbo to develop a specialized server for AJAX, or transparently expose the internal Dubbo service directly to JavaScript in the browser. Of course, many AJAX applications work better with web frameworks, so direct access to the Dubbo service may not be an exquisite architecture in many web projects. Provide a text-based, easy-to-read remote call method for Dubbo systems within the enterprise (that is, both the service provider and the consumer are Dubbo-based systems). Simplify the call from the Dubbo system to other heterogeneous systems. You can use a simple way like Dubbo to \"transparently\" call REST services provided by Non-Dubbo systems (regardless of whether the service provider is inside or outside the enterprise) It should be pointed out that I think that 1~3 are the most valuable application scenarios for Dubbo's REST call. And the main purpose why we add REST calls for Dubbo is to provide a service-oriented provider. In other words, to develop REST services for Non-Dubbo (heterogeneous) consumers. To sum up, all application scenarios are shown below: Borrowing the most famous slogan of Java in the past, by adding REST calls to Dubbo, you can implement the \"Write once, access everywhere\" service, which can theoretically be accessed all over the world, thus truly achieving an idealized Service-oriented Architecture (SOA). Of course, traditional Web Services (WSDL/SOAP) can meet the requirements (even those that require enterprise-level features) of the above scenarios (except for scenario 4). But due to the complexity and other issues, they are less and less used.","title":"Application scenarios"},{"location":"user/rest/#quick-start","text":"Developing a RESTful service in Dubbo is relatively straightforward. Let's take a simple user registration service for example. The function to be implemented by this service is to provide the following URL (Note: This URL is not entirely RESTful, but more straightforward and more practical): http://localhost:8080/users/register Any client can POST a JSON string containing the user's information to the above URL to complete the user registration. First, implement the interface of the service: public class UserService { void registerUser(User user); } Then, implement the service: @Path( users ) public class UserServiceImpl implements UserService { @POST @Path( register ) @Consumes({MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON}) public void registerUser(User user) { // save the user... } } The above implementation code for the service is very simple, but since the REST service is to be published to a specific HTTP URL so they can be accessed by clients written by any language or even a browser, there are a few additional JAX-RS standard annotations to be added for the relevant configuration: @Path(\"users\"): Specify that the relative path for UserService is /users , standing for http://localhost:8080/users @Path(\"register\"): Specify that the relative path for registerUser() is /register . Combining the previous @Path specified for UserService , the URL to call UserService.register() is HTTP://localhost:8080/users/register @POST: Specify that registerUser() should be accessed with HTTP POST method @Consumes({MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON}): Specify that registerUser() receives data in JSON format. The REST framework will automatically deserialize JSON data into a User object. Finally, add this service to the spring configuration file and finish all service development work: ```xml ## Introduction to Standard Java REST API: JAX-RS JAX-RS is a standard Java REST API that has been widely supported and applied in the industry. There are many well-known open source implementations, including Oracle's Jersey, RedHat's RestEasy, Apache's CXF and Wink, restlet, etc. In addition, all commercial JavaEE application servers that support the JavaEE 6.0 specifications or above support JAX-RS. Therefore, JAX-RS is a very mature solution, and it does not have any so-called vendor lock-in problems. JAX-RS has a wealth of information on the web, such as the following introductory tutorial: * Oracle official tutorial: http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/doc/jaxrs.htm * Article on IBM developerWorks China: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cn/java/j-lo-jaxrs/ For more information, please feel free to Google or Baidu. As far as learning JAX-RS is concerned, it is generally enough to master the usage of various annotations. Note: Dubbo is based on the JAX-RS 2.0, and sometimes you need to pay attention to the version of the reference material or REST implementation. ## REST Service Provider Details In this section, we will expand the `UserService` in the Quick Start to further demonstrate the development points of the REST service provider in Dubbo. ### Implementation of HTTP POST/GET Although it's recommended to use the four standard methods (POST, DELETE, PUT and GET) in the HTTP protocol to implement common CRUD in REST services, but in practice, we generally use POST to implement create and update, and use GET to implement delete and read (DELETE and PUT will even be blocked by some firewalls). The implementation of POST has already been briefly demonstrated. Here, we will add a function to get the registered user data to `UserService`, in order to demonstrate the implementation of GET. This function is to enable the client to obtain user data of different IDs by accessing different URLs as follows: http://localhost:8080/users/1001 http://localhost:8080/users/1002 http://localhost:8080/users/1003 Of course, you can use other forms of URLs to access user data of different IDs, for example: http://localhost:8080/users/load?id=1001 JAX-RS itself can support all of these forms. However, the first form of including query parameters in the URL path (http://localhost:8080/users/1001) is more in line with the general habit of REST, so it is recommended to use. Below we will add a `getUser()` method to the `UserService` to implement this form of URL access: ```java @GET @Path( {id : \\\\d+} ) @Produces({MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON}) public User getUser(@PathParam( id ) Long id) { // ... } @GET: Specify that the method shoule be accessed with HTTP GET method @Path(\"{id : \\d+}\"): According to the above functional requirements, the URL to access getUser() should be \"http://localhost:8080/users/ + any number\", and this number should passed to getUser() method as parameter passed to the getUser() method. In the annotation here, the {id: xxx} in @Path specifies that the relative path contains the id parameter, and its value will be automatically passed to the method parameter id annotated with @PathParam(\"id\"). \\d+ following {id: is a regular expression specifies that the id parameter must be a number. @Produces({MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON}): Specify that getUser() outputs data in JSON format. The REST framework automatically serializes the User object into JSON data.","title":"Quick Start"},{"location":"user/rest/#is-annotation-put-in-interface-class-or-implementation-class","text":"The development of REST services based on Dubbo is mainly configured through JAX-RS annotations. In the above example, we put the annotation in the implementation class of the service. But in fact, we can completely put the annotation in the interface of the service. These two methods are completely equivalent, for example: @Path( users ) public interface UserService { @GET @Path( {id : \\\\d+} ) @Produces({MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON}) User getUser(@PathParam( id ) Long id); } In a typical application, we recommend put the annotation in the service implementation class. Then, annotations are closer to Java implementation code and easier to develop and maintain. More importantly, we generally tend to avoid contamination of the interface, maintaining the purity and wide applicability of the interface. However, as will be described later, if we access this service by using the consumer directly developed by Dubbo, the annotation must be put in the interface. If the interface and the implementation class are both added annotation at the same time, the implementation configuration of the implementation class will take effect, and the annotation on the interface will be ignored.","title":"Is annotation put in interface class or implementation class?"},{"location":"user/rest/#support-for-json-xml-and-other-data-formats","text":"The dubbo REST services can support the transmission of data in multiple formats to provide maximum flexibility to the client.

But in dubbo, we also automatically support the current common use of the industry, that is, use a URL suffix (.json and .xml) to specify the data format you want to use. For example, after adding the above annotation, directly accessing http://localhost:8888/users/1001.json means using the json format, and directly accessing http://localhost:8888/users/1002.xml means using the xml format. It's simpler and more intuitive than using HTTP Header. This way is used by the REST APIs of Twitter, Weibo, etc. If you don't add HTTP header or suffix, the REST of dubbo will give priority to enable the top ranked data format in the above definition of annotation. Note: To support XML format data, you can use either MediaType.TEXT_XML or MediaType.APPLICATION_XML in annotation, but TEXT_XML is more commonly used, and if you want to use the above URL suffix to specify the data format, you can only configure it as TEXT_XML to take effect.","title":"Support for JSON, XML and other data formats"},{"location":"user/rest/#chinese-character-support","text":"In order to output Chinese characters normally in dubbo REST, as with the usual Java web applications, we need to set the contentType of the HTTP response to UTF-8 encoding.

For example, we want the above registerUser() method to return the ID number generated by the server for the user: long registerUser(User user); Because the primitive type is not supported by JAXB serialization, add a wrapper object: @XmlRootElement public class RegistrationResult implements Serializable { private Long id; public RegistrationResult() { } public RegistrationResult(Long id) { this.id = id; } public Long getId() { return id; } public void setId(Long id) { this.id = id; } } And modify the service method: RegistrationResult registerUser(User user); This not only solves the problem of XML serialization, but also makes the returned data conform to the specifications of XML and JSON. For example, in JSON, the returned form would be as follows: { id : 1001} If you do not add a wrapper, the JSON return value will be directly 1001 In XML, the return value after adding wrapper will be: registrationResult id 1002 /id /registrationResult This wrapper object actually uses the so-called Data Transfer Object (DTO) mode, and DTO can also make more useful customizations for transferring data.

At the same time, if you do not configure the server attribute, the rest protocol also uses jetty by default. jetty is a very mature java servlet container and has a good integration with dubbob (Among the five embedded servers, Only jetty and later tomcat\u3001tjws, complete seamless integration with Dubbo monitoring system.), so, if your dubbo system is a separate process, you can use jetty by default. dubbo:protocol name= rest server= tomcat / The above configuration uses the embedded tomcat to do the rest server.On embedded tomcat, REST performance is much better than jetty (See the benchmark below). It is recommended that Tomcat is used in scenarios where high performance is required. dubbo:protocol name= rest server= netty / The above configuration uses embedded netty to do the rest server. (TODO more contents to add) dubbo:protocol name= rest server= tjws / (tjws is now deprecated) dubbo:protocol name= rest server= sunhttp / The above configuration uses embedded tjws or Sun HTTP server to do the rest server. These two server implementations are very lightweight, it is very convenient for quick start-up in integration testing, of course, it can also be used in a production environment with low load. Note: tjws is currently deprecated because it does not work well with the servlet 3.1 API. If your dubbo system is not a separate process, instead of deploying to a Java application server, we recommend the following configuration: dubbo:protocol name= rest server= servlet / By setting the server as the servlet, dubbo will use the servlet container of the external application server to do the rest server.

In fact, you can still stick to the embedded server in this scenario, but the servlet container of the external application server is often more powerful than the embedded server(Especially if you are deploying to a more robust and scalable WebLogic, WebSphere, etc.).

For instance, the IP address from the Client. We provide two methods to get the Client's IP in dubbo. The first one is using @Context annotation from JAX-RS: public User getUser(@PathParam( id ) Long id, @Context HttpServletRequest request) { System.out.println( Client address is + request.getRemoteAddr()); } After decorating a parameter of getUser() with Context, we can inject the current HttpServletRequest and then call the servlet api to get the IP. Notice: This method can only be used when the server is one of the followings: twjs, tomecat, jetty or servlet. All of them provide servlet container. In addition, standard JAX-RS also allow us to get HttpServletRequest using an instance field in service Class decorated by @Context . The second method is to use RpcContext, which is commonly seen in dubbo: public User getUser(@PathParam( id ) Long id) { System.out.println( Client address is + RpcContext.getContext().getRemoteAddressString()); } Notice: Similarly, this method only works in the jetty, tomcat, servlet or tjws server. In dubbo, the usage of RpcContext is rather invasive. We are likely to refactor it in the future. The first method is suggested when your project may run without dubbo and need the compatibility with JAX-RS. But if you want a more elegant service interface definition, the second method would be the better choice. What's more, in the newest version of dubbo REST service, RpcContext could be used to get HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse, providing great flexibility for users to implement some complex functions. The following is an example: if (RpcContext.getContext().getRequest() != null RpcContext.getContext().getRequest() instanceof HttpServletRequest) { System.out.println( Client address is + ((HttpServletRequest) RpcContext.getContext().getRequest()).getRemoteAddr()); } if (RpcContext.getContext().getResponse() != null RpcContext.getContext().getResponse() instanceof HttpServletResponse) { System.out.println( Response object from RpcContext: + RpcContext.getContext().getResponse()); } Notice: In order to maintain the neutrality of the protocol, RpcContext.getRequest() and RpcContext.getResponse() only return an Object which could be null. Therefore, you have to check the type on your own. Notice: only when you use jetty, tomcat, servlet as the server can you get the HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse as expected. Because only these server implemented the servlet container. To simplify the programme, you can also use generic to get a specific type of request/response: if (RpcContext.getContext().getRequest(HttpServletRequest.class) != null) { System.out.println( Client address is + RpcContext.getContext().getRequest(HttpServletRequest.class).getRemoteAddr()); } if (RpcContext.getContext().getResponse(HttpServletResponse.class) != null) { System.out.println( Response object from RpcContext: + RpcContext.getContext().getResponse(HttpServletResponse.class)); } If request/response does not correspond to the specific type, it would return null.","title":"Get Context Information"},{"location":"user/rest/#configure-the-port-number-and-context-path","text":"The REST protocol in dubbo use 80 as the default port.

XML is less intrusive to code, especially for dynamically modifying configurations, especially when you want to modify the timeout for connection of a single service configuration, the maximum number of connections per client, cluster policy, weights, and so on.

In Dubbo, we register Filter and Interceptor by adding an XML configuration: dubbo:protocol name= rest port= 8888 extension= xxx.TraceInterceptor, xxx.TraceFilter / Here, we can add these three types of objects, Filter, Interceptor and DynamicFeature, to the extension attributes, separated by commas. (DynamicFeature is another interface that allows us to enable Filter and Interceptor more dynamically. Please feel free to google.) Of course, Dubbo itself also supports Filter, but the Filter and Interceptor we discuss here are more like the bottom of the protocol implementation. Compared to Dubbo's filter, you can do a lower level of customization here. Note: The XML attribute here is called extension, not interceptor or filter. That is because we will add more extension types in addition to Interceptor and Filter in the future. If the REST consumer is also a Dubbo system (see discussion below), you can also configure the Interceptor and Filter for the consumer in a similar way.

At least one advantage of placing an annotation on an interface is that the Dubbo client can share information about the interface. The input validation can be done locally even without RPC. Then turn on the validation in the XML configuration in the same way as Dubbo: dubbo:service interface=xxx.UserService ref= userService protocol= rest validation= true / In many other RPC protocols of Dubbo, if the input validation error occurs, the RpcException is directly thrown to the client, but in the rest, since the client is often non-Dubbo or even non-Java system, it is inconvenient to directly throw a Java exception.

Of course, adding annotations directly to the service code basically has no negative effects, and this is itself a standard usage in Java EE. In addition, JAX-RS and JAXB annotations belong to the Java standard. Compared with spring, Dubbo, etc., which we often use, annotations have no problem with vendor lock-in, so there is usually no need to introduce additional objects. In addition,when you want to use the @Context annotation mentioned above, injecting HttpServletRequest through method parameters (such as public User getUser(@PathParam(\"id\") Long id, @Context HttpServletRequest request) ), the method signature of service is changed and HttpServletRequest is a REST-specific parameter, you should introduce additional Facade classes if your service supports multiple RPC mechanisms.

I would like to give you some preliminary ideas. Please correct me: Spring MVC also supports configuration using annotation, which actually looks very similar to jax-rs. Personally, I think Spring MVC is better suited to restful services of web applications, such as being invoked by AJAX, or possibly outputting HTML or something like page jump processes in applications. Spring MVC can handle both normal web page requests and rest requests at the same time. But in general, the restful service is implemented in the presentation layer or the web layer. But Jax-rs is more suitable for pure service-oriented applications, that is, the middle-tier services in traditional Java EE, for example, it can publish traditional EJB as restful services. In a Spring application, the bean that acts as a service in the Spring is directly published as a restful service. In general, the restful service is at the business layer, application layer, or facade layer. And MVC hierarchies and concepts are often of little value in such (back-end) applications. Of course, some implementations of jax-rs, such as jersey, also try to include MVC to better accommodate the web applications described above, but not as well as Spring MVC. In Dubbo applications, I think a lot of people prefer to publish a local Spring service bean (or manager) as a remote service directly and transparently, so that it is more straightforward to use JAX-RS here, and there is no need to introduce the MVC concept. Of course, we do not discuss whether transparent publishing of remote services is a best practice or whether to add facade things here first. Of course, I know that many people use Spring MVC restful to call Dubbo (spring) service to publish restful services under the situation that Dubbo does not support rest now. It\u2019s a good method also in my opinion, but if you do not modify Spring MVC and integrate it deeply with Dubbo, restful services cannot enjoy many advanced services such as registering to the Dubbo Registry, monitoring the number of calls, TPS, response time through the Dubbo Monitor, controlling the size of the thread pool and the maximum number of connections through the unified configuration of Dubbo, and controlling the service flow, authority and frequency through Dubbo unified mode like other remote call protocol such as webservices, Dubbo rpc, hessian and so on in Dubbo system. In addition, Spring MVC only works in server side and Spring restTemplate are usually used on consumer side. If restTemplate is not integrated with Dubbo, the service can be downgraded by Dubbo client automatically or manually. If the server and consumer are all Dubbo system, you cannot use unified routing and other functions in Dubbo if the Spring rest is not deeply integrated into Dubbo through interaction of Spring and rest. Of course, I personally think that these things are not necessarily to be one or the other. I heard that Rod Johnson, the founder of spring usually says \u2018the customer is always right,\u2019 In fact, it is better to support both ways at the same time rather than discuss which way is better, so that originally I wrote in the document that we plan to support Spring rest annotation, but the feasibility is unknown.","title":"Comparison of JAX-RS Between Spring MVC"},{"location":"user/rest/#future","text":"Functions may be supported later: Rest annotation for Spring MVC Safety System OAuth Asynchronous calls Gzip Payload maxsize","title":"Future"},{"location":"user/simple-monitor/","text":"Monitor service is a standard Dubbo service\uff0ccan be exported to the registry\uff0calso can be connected straightly\u3002 Install the simple registry export a simple monitor service to the registry: (If you use the installer, you don't need to write this configuration yourself. if you implement the monitor service yourself\uff0cneed it) ```xml ``` Discovery the monitor service int the registry: xml dubbo:monitor protocol=\"registry\" / or dubbo.properties xml dubbo.monitor.protocol=registry Export a simple monitor service \uff0cbut don't register it to th registry: (If you use the installer, you don't need to write this configuration yourself. if you implement the monitor service yourself\uff0cneed it) ```xml ``` connected to the monitor service straightly xml dubbo:monitor address=\"dubbo://127.0.0.1:7070/org.apache.dubbo.monitor.MonitorService\" / or\uff1a sh dubbo:monitor address=\"127.0.0.1:7070\" / or\uff1a dubbo.properties sh dubbo.monitor.address=127.0.0.1:7070","title":"Simple monitor"},{"location":"user/configuration/","text":"Configuration","title":"Configuration"},{"location":"user/configuration/#configuration","text":"","title":"Configuration"},{"location":"user/configuration/annotation/","text":"Annotation Configuration Requires 2.6.3 or higher click here to view the complete sample Provider Side Service annotation for exporting @Service public class AnnotationServiceImpl implements AnnotationService { @Override public String sayHello(String name) { return annotation: hello, + name;

Eventually, all configurations are aggregated to the data bus URL to drive subsequent service exposure, reference and other processes.

Consumer RpcContext.getContext().setAttachment(Constants.REQUEST_TAG_KEY, red ); The scope of the request.tag is for each invocation, using the attachment to pass the request tag. Note that the value stored in the attachment will be passed continuously in a complete remote invocation, thanks to this feature, we only need to set the tag at the beginning of a invocation. Currently, only hardcoding is supported to set requestTag. Note that RpcContext is thread-bound, elegantly using the TagRouter feature, it is recommended to set the request tag via a servlet filter (in the web environment) or a custom dubbo SPI filter. Rules: request.tag=red will firstlt choose the provider which configures as tag=red . If there is no service corresponding to the request tag in the cluster, it will downgrade to tag=null provider, seen as default provider\u3002 when request.tag=null , only tag=null provider will be matched. Even if there are services available in the cluster, the tags do not match, they cannot be called. This is different from rule 1.

Excluding registry center governance requirements, a large part of configurations are used by the provider itself and do not need to be delivered to the consumer. This part of the data does not need to be written to the registry, but only needs to be persisted as key-value. There are also 20+ configurations in dubbo consumer. In the registry center, only a few configurations such as application, version, group, ip, dubbo version are needed in the list of service consumers. Other configurations can also be persisted in key-value form. This data is registered into the registry in the service dimension, which leads to the expansion of data volume, and then causes the increased network overhead of the registry (such as zookeeper) and decreased performance. In addition to the storage of the above configuration items, Dubbo service metadata information also needs to be stored. Metadata information includes service interface and method information of interface. This information will be used for service mock, service test. Goal The original data and metadata information in the registry center need to be stored in a separate key-value store, which can be DB, redis or other persistent storage. The core code supports zookeeper, redis(recommended) by default. The format of provider storage content is the storage after gson's serialization of org.apache.dubbo.metadata.definition.model.FullServiceDefinition. Consumer gets parameter information from the URL that it wrote to the registry and stores it in Map. That is, get the Map with URL.getParameterMap() and store it after gson's serialization. For more details, you can refer to the sample below. Configuration The default metadata storage supports the following additional features: * Failed retry * Refresh regularly Failed retry Failed retries can be configured by retrytimes (retry times, default 100), retryperiod (retry cycle, default 3000ms). Refresh regularly It's opening by default and can be turned off by setting cycleReport=false. Complete configurations: dubbo.metadata-report.address=zookeeper://127.0.0.1:2181 dubbo.metadata-report.username=xxx ##Not necessary dubbo.metadata-report.password=xxx ##Not necessary dubbo.metadata-report.retry-times=30 ##Not necessary,default 100 dubbo.metadata-report.retry-period=5000 ##Not necessary,default 3000 dubbo.metadata-report.cycle-report=false ##Not necessary,default true If the metadata address (dubbo.metadata-report.address) is not configured, the writing of the entire metadata will not take effect, but it will not affect the running of the program. Let's look at a few sample configurations. Regardless of the configuration, some maven dependencies need to be introduced: dependency groupId org.apache.dubbo /groupId artifactId dubbo-metadata-report-zookeeper /artifactId /dependency If redis is needed, the corresponding redis dependencies can be introduced: dependency groupId org.apache.dubbo /groupId artifactId dubbo-metadata-report-redis /artifactId /dependency Complete sample\uff0crefer to sample-2.7 Method 1: Config in Configcenter Refer to the sample: dubbo-samples-metadata-report/dubbo-samples-metadata-report-configcenter. Configcenter Configuration Configurations of Configcenter\uff0ccan refer to the document of Configcenter. As follows: dubbo.registry.address=zookeeper://127.0.0.1:2181 ### Notice the hump style dubbo.metadata-report.address=zookeeper://127.0.0.1:2181 ###Address of metadata storage In the sample, Zookeeper is used as the Configcenter. Run directly: org.Apache.Dubbo.Samples.Metadatareport.Configcenter.ZKTools after starting a local zookeeper service, then writing finished. You can also use Nacos, Apollo as the Configcenter. These products themselves support ops configuration. Application Configuration ###dubbo.properties dubbo.config-center.address=zookeeper://127.0.0.1:2181 ... After completing the above two steps, the registry address and metadata address are retrieved from the Configcenter. You can now run the Provider and the Consumer in turn and get the corresponding output in console or view it directly through the client of zookeeper. Provider Configuration The metadata stored on the Provider side is as follows: { parameters : { side : provider , methods : sayHello , dubbo : 2.0.2 , threads : 100 , interface : org.apache.dubbo.samples.metadatareport.configcenter.api.AnnotationService , threadpool : fixed , version : 1.1.1 , generic : false , revision : 1.1.1 , valid : true , application : metadatareport-configcenter-provider , default.timeout : 5000 , group : d-test , anyhost : true }, canonicalName : org.apache.dubbo.samples.metadatareport.configcenter.api.AnnotationService , codeSource : file:/Users/cvictory/workspace/work-mw/dubbo-samples/dubbo-samples-metadata-report/dubbo-samples-metadata-report-configcenter/target/classes/ , methods : [{ name : sayHello , parameterTypes : [ java.lang.String ], returnType : java.lang.String }], types : [{ type : java.lang.String , properties : { value : { type : char[] }, hash : { type : int } } }, { type : int }, { type : char }] } The Provider side stores all the parameters that the Provider service fills in to the registry, as well as the method information of the service (method name, input and output format). Consumer Configuration { valid : true , side : consumer , application : metadatareport-configcenter-consumer , methods : sayHello , default.timeout : 6666 , dubbo : 2.0.2 , interface : org.apache.dubbo.samples.metadatareport.configcenter.api.AnnotationService , version : 1.1.1 , revision : 1.1.1 , group : d-test } The Consumer side stores all the parameters that the Consumer fills in to the registry. The above example is mainly a presentation of the provider side service information and consumer side service information stored in the metadata area by placing the metadata address in the Configcenter. The next two examples focus on configuring in a project: the XML mode and the annotation mode . Method 2: Config project in properties way Refer to the sample: dubbo-samples-metadata-report/dubbo-samples-metadata-report-local-xml. dubbo.properties dubbo.metadata-report.address=zookeeper://127.0.0.1:2181 After setting this configuration, have not to focus on others. You can also view the service information of the corresponding provider and consumer directly. Provider stores: { parameters : { valid : true , async : true , side : provider , application : metadatareport-local-xml-provider , methods : sayHello , dubbo : 2.0.2 , interface : org.apache.dubbo.samples.metadatareport.local.xml.api.DemoService , generic : false , anyhost : true }, canonicalName : org.apache.dubbo.samples.metadatareport.local.xml.api.DemoService , codeSource : file:/Users/cvictory/workspace/work-mw/dubbo-samples/dubbo-samples-metadata-report/dubbo-samples-metadata-report-local-xml/target/classes/ , methods : [{ name : sayHello , parameterTypes : [ java.lang.String ], returnType : java.lang.String }], types : [{ type : int }, { type : char }, { type : java.lang.String , properties : { value : { type : char[] }, hash : { type : int } } }] } Consumer stores: { valid : true , side : consumer , application : metadatareport-local-xml-consumer , methods : sayHello , dubbo : 2.0.2 , interface : org.apache.dubbo.samples.metadatareport.local.xml.api.DemoService } Method 3: Config project in annotation way Refer to the sample: dubbo-samples-metadata-report/dubbo-samples-metadata-report-local-annotaion. @Bean introduce Bean @Bean public MetadataReportConfig metadataReportConfig() { MetadataReportConfig metadataReportConfig = new MetadataReportConfig(); metadataReportConfig.setAddress( zookeeper://127.0.0.1:2181 ); return metadataReportConfig; } After introducing Bean, also have not to set others. View corresponding service information directly: Provider stores: { parameters : { side : provider , methods : sayHello , dubbo : 2.0.2 , interface : org.apache.dubbo.samples.metadatareport.local.annotation.api.AnnotationService , version : 1.1.8 , generic : false , revision : 1.1.8 , valid : true , application : metadatareport-local-annotaion-provider , default.timeout : 1000 , group : d-test , anyhost : true }, canonicalName : org.apache.dubbo.samples.metadatareport.local.annotation.api.AnnotationService , codeSource : file:/Users/cvictory/workspace/work-mw/dubbo-samples/dubbo-samples-metadata-report/dubbo-samples-metadata-report-local-annotaion/target/classes/ , methods : [{ name : sayHello , parameterTypes : [ java.lang.String ], returnType : java.lang.String }], types : [{ type : int }, { type : java.lang.String , properties : { value : { type : char[] }, hash : { type : int } } }, { type : char }] } Consumer stores: { valid : true , side : consumer , application : metadatareport-local-annotaion-consumer , methods : sayHello , dubbo : 2.0.2 , interface : org.apache.dubbo.samples.metadatareport.local.annotation.api.AnnotationService , version : 1.1.8 , revision : 1.1.8 , group : d-test } Extension SPI Definition Refer to: org.apache.dubbo.metadata.store.MetadataReportFactory, org.apache.dubbo.metadata.store.MetadataReport @SPI( redis ) public interface MetadataReportFactory { @Adaptive({ protocol }) MetadataReport getMetadataReport(URL url); } Custom metadata storage Let's take Redis storage as an example to illustrate. Create a new project supporting the following modifications: Extend AbstractMetadataReport public class RedisMetadataReport extends AbstractMetadataReport { private final static Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(RedisMetadataReport.class); final JedisPool pool; public RedisMetadataReport(URL url) { super(url); pool = new JedisPool(new JedisPoolConfig(), url.getHost(), url.getPort()); } @Override protected void doStoreProviderMetadata(ProviderMetadataIdentifier providerMetadataIdentifier, String serviceDefinitions) { this.storeMetadata(providerMetadataIdentifier, serviceDefinitions); } @Override protected void doStoreConsumerMetadata(ConsumerMetadataIdentifier consumerMetadataIdentifier, String value) { this.storeMetadata(consumerMetadataIdentifier, value); } private void storeMetadata(MetadataIdentifier metadataIdentifier, String v) { try (Jedis jedis = pool.getResource()) { jedis.set(metadataIdentifier.getIdentifierKey() + META_DATA_SOTRE_TAG, v); } catch (Throwable e) { logger.error( Failed to put + metadataIdentifier + to redis + v + , cause: + e.getMessage(), e); throw new RpcException( Failed to put + metadataIdentifier + to redis + v + , cause: + e.getMessage(), e); } } } Extend AbstractMetadataReportFactory public class RedisMetadataReportFactory extends AbstractMetadataReportFactory { @Override public MetadataReport createMetadataReport(URL url) { return new RedisMetadataReport(url); } } New META-INF/dubbo/internal/org.apache.dubbo.metadata.store.MetadataReportFactory redis=org.apache.dubbo.metadata.store.redis.RedisMetadataReportFactory As long as the above modifications along with the project are packaged into a jar, then config metadata center url: redis://10.20.153.10:6379.

How to Use Add zookeeper client dependency in both provider and consumer: dependency groupId org.apache.zookeeper /groupId artifactId zookeeper /artifactId version 3.3.3 /version /dependency Or download directly from apache. Dubbo supports two zookeeper clients: zkclient and curator: Use zkclient Since 2.2.0 dubbo uses zkclient by default, in order to improve the robustness. zkclient is a zookeeper client implementation open-sourced by Datameer. Note: The implementation of zkclient has been removed in the 2.7.x version. If you want to use the zkclient client, you need to extend it yourself. Default configuration: dubbo:registry ... client= zkclient / Or: dubbo.registry.client=zkclient Or: zookeeper://10.20.153.10:2181?client=zkclient In order to use it, need to explicitly declare the following maven dependency or download its client . dependency groupId com.github.sgroschupf /groupId artifactId zkclient /artifactId version 0.1 /version /dependency Use curator Since 2.3.0 dubbo also supports curator but explicit configuration is required.
