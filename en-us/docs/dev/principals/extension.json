Util. The ServiceLoader</code>, namely extension in the jar package <code>meta-inf/services /</code> directory placed with interface of text files, with the same content for interface implementation class name, multiple separate implementation class name with a newline.Need to expand Dubbo agreement, for example, simply by XXX. Placed in a jar file: <code>meta-inf/services/com. Alibaba. Dubbo. RPC. Protocol</code>, contents for <code>com. Alibaba. XXX. XxxProtocol</code>.Dubbo by ServiceLoader scanning to all Protocol implementation.</p>\n<p>All plug-in and agreed, must be marked with: <code>@ the Extension</code> (&quot; name &quot;), as the identity of the name, after loading is used to configure option.</p>\n<h2>Step 2 each extension point encapsulate a change factor, only to maximize reuse</h2>\n<p>Each extension point implementers, usually only care about one thing, now the extension points, is not entirely separate.Such as: Failover, the Route, LoadBalance, Directory not completely separate, all written by RoutingInvokerGroup died.</p>\n<p>Again, for example, protocol extension, the extension may just want to replace the serialization way, or just replace transmission mode, and Remoting and Http can also reuse serialization, <a href=\"http://etc.In\">etc.In</a> this way, the need for transport, the client, the server implementation, protocol parsing, data serialization, allow different extension point.</p>\n<p>After break up, the design is as follows:</p>\n<p><img src=\"../sources/images/design-step2.png\" alt=\"design-step-2\"></p>\n<h2>Step 3, the entire pipeline design, logic framework itself, are implemented using cross section intercept</h2>\n<p>Now a lot of logic, are placed in the base class implementation, then by the method of template back to the realization of the tone categories, including: local, mock, generic, echo, token, accesslog, monitor, count, limit, etc., can use the Filter to realize all split, each function is called a ring on the chain.Such as: (the base class template method)</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">public</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">abstract</span> AbstractInvoker implements Invoker {  \n  \n    <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">public</span> Result <span class=\"hljs-title\">invoke</span><span class=\"hljs-params\">(Invocation inv)</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">throws</span> RpcException </span>{  \n        <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Pseudo code  </span>\n        active ++;  \n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> (active &gt; max)  \n            wait();  \n          \n        doInvoke(inv);  \n          \n        active --;  \n        notify();  \n    }  \n      \n    <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">protected</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">abstract</span> Result <span class=\"hljs-title\">doInvoke</span><span class=\"hljs-params\">(Invocation inv)</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">throws</span> RpcException  \n  \n}  \n</span></code></pre>\n<p>To: (chain filter)</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">public</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">abstract</span> LimitFilter implements Filter {  \n  \n    <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">public</span> Result <span class=\"hljs-title\">invoke</span><span class=\"hljs-params\">(Invoker chain, Invocation inv)</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">throws</span> RpcException </span>{  \n         <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Pseudo code  </span>\n        active ++;  \n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> (active &gt; max)  \n            wait();  \n          \n        chain.invoke(inv);  \n          \n        active --;  \n        notify();  \n    }  \n  \n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Step 4, a minimum concept, consistent conceptual model</h2>\n<p>Keep the concept of as little as possible, help to understand, for open systems is particularly <a href=\"http://important.In\">important.In</a> addition, the interface can use a consistent conceptual model, can guide each other, and reduce the model transformation,</p>\n<p>For example, Invoker method signature as follows:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\"><span class=\"hljs-function\">Result <span class=\"hljs-title\">invoke</span><span class=\"hljs-params\">(Invocation invocation)</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">throws</span> RpcException</span>;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The Exporter method signature as follows:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\"><span class=\"hljs-function\">Object <span class=\"hljs-title\">invoke</span><span class=\"hljs-params\">(Method method, Object[] args)</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">throws</span> Throwable</span>;  \n</code></pre>\n<p>But they are the same, only is a on the client side, one on the server side, different model classes are applied.</p>\n<p>For example, the URL string, parse and assembled, not a URL model classes, and the Parameters of the URL, but sometimes the Map, and sometimes the Parameters class wrapping,</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">export(String url)  \ncreateExporter(String host, <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">int</span> port, Parameters params);  \n</code></pre>\n<p>Use consistent model:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">export(URL url)  \ncreateExporter(URL url);  \n</code></pre>\n<p>For example, the existing: Invoker, Exporter, InvocationHandler, FilterChainAre actually invoke behavior at different stages, can abstract away completely, unified for the Invoker, reduce the concept.</p>\n<h2>Step 5, hierarchical, modular extensions, rather than generic type extension</h2>\n<p>Why see:<a href=\"../principals/expansibility.md\">expansibility</a>。</p>\n<p>Generalization expansion refers to: the extension point gradually abstraction, take all functions, sets and new function is always set in and expand the function of the old concept.</p>\n<p>Combined extension refers to: the extension points orthogonal decomposition, all functions of overlap, new function is always based on the old function implementation.</p>\n<p>The above design, unconsciously will Dubbo existing function as the core functionality.Above contains the concept of Dubbo existing RPC all functions, including: the Proxy, the Router, Failover, LoadBalance, Subscriber, Publisher, Invoker, Exporter, Filter, etc.,\nBut these are the core?RPC can Run, kicked off what?And what is not kick off?Based on this consideration, the RPC can be broken down into two levels, Protocol and Invoker is the core of RPC.Other, including the Router, Failover, Loadbalance, Subscriber, the Publisher is the core, but the Routing.Therefore, the Routing as an extension of the Rpc core, design is as follows:</p>\n<p><img src=\"../sources/images/design-step3.png\" alt=\"design-step-3\"></p>\n<h2>Step 6, and networking</h2>\n<p>After finishing, the design is as follows:</p>\n<p><img src=\"../sources/images/design-step4.png\" alt=\"design-step-4\"></p>\n",
