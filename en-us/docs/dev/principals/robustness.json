retry - recovery</h2>\n<p>High availability components to tolerate its dependence on the failure of the component.</p>\n<h3>Dubbo service registry</h3>\n<p>The service registry using the database to store the information service providers and consumers.Different registry registry cluster through the database to synchronize data, to perceive other providers on the registry.Registry would ensure a provider and consumer data in memory, the database is unavailable, independent of the normal operation of foreign registry, just can't get other registry data.When the database recovery, retry logic will modify memory write data back to the database, and get a new database data.</p>\n<h3>Service consumers</h3>\n<p>After the message service provider list from the registry, will save the provider list to memory and disk file.Consumers can function properly after this registry is down, even in the registry during outage restart consumers.Consumers started, find the registry is not available, will read the list stored in the disk file provider.Retry logic to ensure the registry after recovery, update the information.</p>\n<h2>Retry delay strategy</h2>\n<p>On a bit of the subproblem.Dubbo encountered two related scenario.</p>\n<h3>On the database lock</h3>\n<p>Registration center will regularly update the database of a record timestamp, such cluster other registry perceive it is alive.Overdue registry and its associated data will be cleared.Database is normal, the mechanism as well.But the database load is high, its every action is slow.This occurs:</p>\n<p>A registry that B expired, delete B data.B find their data, to write their own data repeatedly.These repeated operation and increase load the database, deterioration.</p>\n<p>Use the following logic:</p>\n<p>When data is deleted B found themselves fail (write), choose to wait for this period of time and try again.Can choose to retry time exponentially, such as first class 1 minute, the second for 10 minutes, 100 minutes for the third time.\nThis decrease after operation, ensure database can cooling Down (Cool Down).</p>\n<h3>The Client reconnection registry</h3>\n<p>When a registry downtime, other Client will receive events at the same time, and to reconnect to another registry.The Client number is relatively more, will be the impact of the registry.Avoid method can be a Client reconnection random delay for 3 minutes, when the reconnection spread out.</p>\n",
