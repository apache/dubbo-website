The threading models of the Triple protocol and the Dubbo protocol are introduced separately below.
Dubbo protocol - Provider-side threading model Before introducing the Provider-side threading model of the Dubbo protocol, it is introduced that Dubbo abstracts the operations on the channel into five behaviors:
Establish a connection: connected, the main responsibility is to record the time of read and write in the channel, and handle the callback logic after the connection is established.</description></item><item><title>Consumer Thread Model</title><link>https://dubbo.apache.org/en/docs3-v2/java-sdk/advanced-features-and-usage/performance/threading-model/consumer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dubbo.apache.org/en/docs3-v2/java-sdk/advanced-features-and-usage/performance/threading-model/consumer/</guid><description>The 2.7.5 version has fully optimized the entire call link. According to the pressure test results, the overall QPS performance has been improved by nearly 30%, and the memory allocation overhead during the call process has also been reduced. One of the design points worth mentioning is that 2.7.5 introduces the concept of Servicerepository, which generates ServiceDescriptor and MethodDescriptor in advance in the service registration phase to reduce resource consumption caused by calculating the original information of the Service in the RPC call phase.</description></item></channel></rss>
