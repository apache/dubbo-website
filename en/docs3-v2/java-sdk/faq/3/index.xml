(For example, the protocol configured by the client is the Dubbo protocol, but the server can only provide services of the Rest protocol.)
The registration center (or configuration center) is unreliable and pushes illegal data.
Troubleshooting and resolution steps Check the protocol configuration of both the provider and the consumer. Update the version of the registry.</description></item><item><title>3-2 - Publish or push service failed</title><link>https://dubbo.apache.org/en/docs3-v2/java-sdk/faq/3/2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dubbo.apache.org/en/docs3-v2/java-sdk/faq/3/2/</guid><description>Possible Reason The registration center cannot be connected. The registration center cannot provide external services. Troubleshooting and resolution steps Whether the service and registration center network is normal. Whether the registration center starts normally and can be connected through third-party tools. Whether there is a version compatibility problem between the version referenced by the service and the version of the registration center.</description></item><item><title>3-3 - Failed to generate bytecode via Javassist</title><link>https://dubbo.apache.org/en/docs3-v2/java-sdk/faq/3/3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dubbo.apache.org/en/docs3-v2/java-sdk/faq/3/3/</guid><description>Reminder The meaning of this error code has been adjusted. If you are looking for information of this error code in Dubbo versions prior than (or equal) 3.1.4 or 3.2.0-beta.3, head to 3-8.
(This error code is currently absent.)</description></item><item><title>3-4 - Client sending request timed out</title><link>https://dubbo.apache.org/en/docs3-v2/java-sdk/faq/3/4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dubbo.apache.org/en/docs3-v2/java-sdk/faq/3/4/</guid><description>Possible Reason The number of client connections is too high, the response is slow, and the request cannot be sent to the server in time. Some reasons for the network. Troubleshooting and resolution steps Whether the network is normal. You can use some third-party tools or jstack [PID] &amp;gt; jstack.log to analyze the stack information and locate it.</description></item><item><title>3-5 - An exception occurred in the asynchronous response</title><link>https://dubbo.apache.org/en/docs3-v2/java-sdk/faq/3/5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dubbo.apache.org/en/docs3-v2/java-sdk/faq/3/5/</guid><description>Possible Reason The business logic does have a runtime exception. The connection is refused due to network reasons. Troubleshooting and resolution steps For the business code, please trace back and check according to the prompt line of the stack. Check whether the network of the service provider is normal.</description></item><item><title>3-6 - An exception occurred in the proxy execution service</title><link>https://dubbo.apache.org/en/docs3-v2/java-sdk/faq/3/6/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dubbo.apache.org/en/docs3-v2/java-sdk/faq/3/6/</guid><description>Possible Reason The current service parameters have been displayed as deprecated. This reminder may appear for generic declaration classes. Troubleshooting and resolution steps Confirm whether there is a display parameter deprecated=true in the URL If this error occurs in the generic declaration class, it will try to create a proxy without the actual interface class.</description></item><item><title>3-7 - Server response timed out</title><link>https://dubbo.apache.org/en/docs3-v2/java-sdk/faq/3/7/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dubbo.apache.org/en/docs3-v2/java-sdk/faq/3/7/</guid><description>The server did not get a response within the time set by the client.
Possible Reason The business processing logic of the server is complex and cannot respond within the effective time. The connection between the server and the client is disconnected, and the network packet is lost. The server load is too high. Troubleshooting and resolution steps Check whether there is indeed a performance bottleneck in the business processing capability of the server.</description></item><item><title>3-8 - Proxy Failure</title><link>https://dubbo.apache.org/en/docs3-v2/java-sdk/faq/3/8/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dubbo.apache.org/en/docs3-v2/java-sdk/faq/3/8/</guid><description>Failed to generate dynamic proxy.
Possible Reason There is dynamic class loading Class format exception Troubleshooting and resolution steps If Fallback to use JDK proxy success is displayed in the log, It means that Dubbo has successfully created a dynamic proxy after automatically falling back to the JDK proxy. If the program is running normally, you can ignore it If the log shows Fallback to use JDK proxy is also failed, Please check whether the corresponding class loading is normal according to the exception stack information, you can use tools such as arthas to assist in troubleshooting</description></item></channel></rss>
