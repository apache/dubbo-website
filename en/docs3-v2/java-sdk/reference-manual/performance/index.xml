Significantly improved service discovery resource utilization. Compared with interface-level services, it is found that the resident memory of a single machine is reduced by 50%, and the GC consumption during the address change period is reduced by an order of magnitude (hundred times -&amp;gt; ten times) Comparing application-level services, it is found that the resident memory of a single machine is reduced by 75%, and the number of GCs tends to zero The following is the detailed pressure measurement process and data</description></item><item><title>RPC Protocol Triple&amp;Dubbo Benchmark</title><link>https://dubbo.apache.org/en/docs3-v2/java-sdk/reference-manual/performance/rpc-benchmarking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dubbo.apache.org/en/docs3-v2/java-sdk/reference-manual/performance/rpc-benchmarking/</guid><description>The Dubbo protocol implementation of Dubbo3 is basically the same as the Dubbo2 version in terms of performance. Since the Triple protocol itself is built based on HTTP/2, the RPC call on a single link is not improved compared with TCP-based Dubbo2, but has a certain decline in some call scenarios. But the greater advantage of the _Triple protocol _ lies in the gateway penetration, versatility, and overall throughput improvement brought about by the Stream communication model.</description></item></channel></rss>
