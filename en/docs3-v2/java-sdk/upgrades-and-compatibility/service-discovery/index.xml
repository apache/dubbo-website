Therefore, to use application-level service discovery, both the consumer and the server must be upgraded to Dubbo 3.0 and new features enabled (enabled by default) to use application-level service discovery in the link. Take advantage of application-level service discovery.
Open method Server After the application is upgraded to Dubbo 3.0, the server will automatically enable the interface-level + application-level dual registration function, and the developer does not need to modify any configuration by default</description></item><item><title>Guidelines for migrating interface-level service discovery to application-level service discovery</title><link>https://dubbo.apache.org/en/docs3-v2/java-sdk/upgrades-and-compatibility/service-discovery/migration-service-discovery/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dubbo.apache.org/en/docs3-v2/java-sdk/upgrades-and-compatibility/service-discovery/migration-service-discovery/</guid><description>**In general, 3.x is fully compatible with 2.x in address registration and discovery, which means that users can choose to upgrade any number of applications or machines in the cluster to 3.x, and at the same time Interoperability with 2.x versions is maintained in the process. ** If you are concerned about the working principle behind migration, please refer to Migration Rule Details and Working Principle
1 Quick upgrade steps Simply modify the pom.</description></item><item><title>Application-level Service Discovery Address Migration Rules Description</title><link>https://dubbo.apache.org/en/docs3-v2/java-sdk/upgrades-and-compatibility/service-discovery/service-discovery-rule/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dubbo.apache.org/en/docs3-v2/java-sdk/upgrades-and-compatibility/service-discovery/service-discovery-rule/</guid><description>State Model Before Dubbo 3, the address registration model was registered to the registry at the interface-level granularity, while the new application-level registration model of Dubbo 3 is registered to the registry at the application-level granularity. The implementation of the registry is almost different, which leads to the inability to merge the invokers obtained from the interface-level registration model with the invokers obtained from the application-level registration model. In order to help users migrate from the interface level to the application level, Dubbo 3 has designed the Migration mechanism, which realizes the switching of the address model in the actual call based on the switching of the three states.</description></item></channel></rss>
