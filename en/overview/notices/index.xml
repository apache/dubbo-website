In theory, users can enable any serialization protocol based on this extension mechanism. This brings great flexibility, but at the same time, users must be aware of the hidden security risks. Data deserialization is the link most easily exploited by attackers, who use it to perform RCE attacks to steal or destroy server-side data. Before switching serialization protocols or implementations, users should fully investigate the security guarantees of the target serialization protocol and its framework implementation, and set up corresponding security measures in advance (such as setting up a black/white list).</description></item><item><title>RPC Protocol Security</title><link>https://dubbo.apache.org/en/overview/notices/protocol/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dubbo.apache.org/en/overview/notices/protocol/</guid><description>Dubbo supports the extension of the RPC protocol.

Risk Dubbo Admin has query and call permissions for the entire cluster by default, so it needs to be used with more caution in the online environment. In addition, in order to reduce the risk of arbitrary access to Dubbo Admin, Dubbo Admin also provides a simple authentication mechanism.</description></item><item><title>Log4j vulnerability impact</title><link>https://dubbo.apache.org/en/overview/notices/log4j/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dubbo.apache.org/en/overview/notices/log4j/</guid><description>Recently, the mainstream logging component log4j2 broke out security vulnerability CVE-2021-44228.
