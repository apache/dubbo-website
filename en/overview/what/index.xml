It officially provides multi-language SDK implementations such as Java and Golang. Microservices developed using Dubbo are natively capable of remote address discovery and communication with each other. Using the rich service governance features provided by Dubbo, service governance demands such as service discovery, load balancing, and traffic scheduling can be realized.</description></item><item><title>Dubbo 3 Quick Facts</title><link>https://dubbo.apache.org/en/overview/what/dubbo3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dubbo.apache.org/en/overview/what/dubbo3/</guid><description>This article will take you to quickly understand the design background, overall architecture and core features of Dubbo3, and its relationship with typical users such as Alibaba HSF2, etc. You can also learn more in the following sections:

The Triple protocol is compatible with gRPC and provides communication models such as Request Response, Request Streaming, Response Streaming, and Bi-directional Streaming; from Triple Starting from the agreement, Dubbo also supports IDL-based service definition.
In addition, Dubbo also integrates most of the industry&amp;rsquo;s mainstream protocols, allowing users to use these communication protocols within the Dubbo framework, providing users with a unified programming model and service governance model, these protocols include rest, hessian2, jsonrpc, thrift, etc.</description></item><item><title>Extensibility</title><link>https://dubbo.apache.org/en/overview/what/extensibility/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dubbo.apache.org/en/overview/what/extensibility/</guid><description>Extended Design Ideas Scalability is what any system pursues, and it is equally applicable to Dubbo.
What is scalability Scalability is a design concept that represents our vision for the future. We hope that based on the existing architecture or design, when some aspects change in the future, we can adapt to this with minimal changes. kind of change.
Advantages of Scalability The advantage of scalability is mainly manifested in the decoupling between modules, which conforms to the principle of opening and closing, which is open to expansion and closed to modification.</description></item><item><title>Ecosystem</title><link>https://dubbo.apache.org/en/overview/what/ecosystem/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dubbo.apache.org/en/overview/what/ecosystem/</guid><description>Dashboard Dubbo-admin Supported Components and Deployment Architectures Dubbo implementations generally support the following products or deployment architectures, and specific multilingual SDK implementations may vary.
Registry Zookeeper Nacos Kubernetes Metadata center Zookeeper Nacos Redis Configuration center Zookeeper Nacos Redis Apollo Mesh Data plane Envoy Control plane Istio Protocols and Interoperability Interoperability with the gRPC system can be realized based on the Triple protocol Based on the REST protocol and application-level service discovery, the interoperability of the Spring Cloud system at the protocol and address discovery levels can be realized SPI Integration There are many Dubbo extension implementations here, including protocols, serialization, registration centers, etc.</description></item></channel></rss>
