&lt;p>Apache Dubbo is an easy-to-use, high-performance WEB and RPC framework, providing capabilities, tools, and best practices for creating enterprise-level microservices including service discovery, traffic governance, observability, and authentication. After several years of development, Dubbo3 has been widely promoted across Alibaba Groupâ€™s business lines, successfully replacing the HSF framework that had been in operation for years; meanwhile, the multi-language ecosystem of Dubbo3 has also developed rapidly, currently covering:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Can web browser pages access Dubbo and gRPC microservices? Dubbo-js alpha version officially released</title><link>https://dubbo.apache.org/en/blog/2023/10/07/can-web-browser-pages-access-dubbo-and-grpc-microservices-dubbo-js-alpha-version-officially-released/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dubbo.apache.org/en/blog/2023/10/07/can-web-browser-pages-access-dubbo-and-grpc-microservices-dubbo-js-alpha-version-officially-released/</guid><description>&lt;p>Based on the Triple protocol defined by Dubbo3, you can easily write browser and gRPC-compatible RPC services, allowing these services to run simultaneously on HTTP/1 and HTTP/2. The &lt;a href="https://github.com/apache/dubbo-js/">Dubbo TypeScript SDK&lt;/a> supports defining services using IDL or language-specific approaches and provides a lightweight API to publish or invoke these services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dubbo-js has officially released its first alpha version supporting the Dubbo3 protocol in September, which promises to transform the architecture and communication models between front-end and back-end of microservices, enabling direct access to back-end Dubbo RPC services from browser pages or web servers. The project is rapidly evolving, and developers interested in participating in the apache/dubbo-js project are welcome to search for the DingTalk group: &lt;strong>29775027779&lt;/strong> to join the developer group.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
