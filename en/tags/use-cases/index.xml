&lt;p>  With the continuous development of Guazi&amp;rsquo;s business, the system scale is gradually expanding. Currently, there are hundreds of Dubbo applications and thousands of Dubbo instances running on Guazi’s private cloud. Various departments at Guazi are rapidly developing their businesses, and the versions have not had the chance to unify, leading to different usage styles across departments. With the construction of the second data center, the demand for a unified Dubbo version has become increasingly urgent. A production incident related to Dubbo occurred months ago, which became the catalyst for upgrading the Dubbo version in the company.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
