In terms of business, Dubbo3 achieved a significant enhancement in user experience by maintaining continuous promotion without degradation. Technically, it greatly improved R&amp;amp;D and operational efficiency while increasing key resources&amp;rsquo; utilization rate, such as address pushing, by over 40%. The integration of Dubbo3&amp;rsquo;s open-source middleware system created Alibaba&amp;rsquo;s best practices and unified standards in the cloud, contributing scalable practical experience and technological innovation to the open-source community, becoming the core source and driving force for the development of open-source microservices technology and standards.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Dubbo3 Application-Level Service Discovery Practice</title><link>https://cn.dubbo.apache.org/en/blog/2023/01/15/industrial-and-commercial-bank-of-china-dubbo3-application-level-service-discovery-practice/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cn.dubbo.apache.org/en/blog/2023/01/15/industrial-and-commercial-bank-of-china-dubbo3-application-level-service-discovery-practice/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="problem-analysis">Problem Analysis&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The following is a classic diagram of Dubbo&amp;rsquo;s operating principle, where service providers and consumers coordinate to achieve automatic address discovery through the registration center.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img alt="icbc-analyze" src="https://cn.dubbo.apache.org/imgs/user/icbc/icbc-analyze.png">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main bottleneck faced by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China is at the registration center and service consumer end; the number of interface-level addresses has reached a scale of hundreds of millions. On one hand, storage capacity has reached its limits, and on the other hand, push efficiency has significantly declined. At the consumer end, the resident memory of the Dubbo2 framework has exceeded 40%, and each address push brings high resource consumption rates such as CPU, affecting normal business calls.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ele.me Successfully Upgrades to Dubbo3</title><link>https://cn.dubbo.apache.org/en/blog/2023/01/15/ele.me-successfully-upgrades-to-dubbo3/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cn.dubbo.apache.org/en/blog/2023/01/15/ele.me-successfully-upgrades-to-dubbo3/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="upgrade-goals">Upgrade Goals&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;img alt="elem-arc" src="https://cn.dubbo.apache.org/imgs/user/eleme/elem-arc.png">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is the basic deployment architecture diagram of Ele.me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before the upgrade, Ele.me&amp;rsquo;s microservice framework used HSF2, and inter-unit RPC calls were routed through a proxy. During this time, the number of machines and traffic supported by the proxy increased rapidly. Notably, after subscribing to all address data, the resource consumption and stability of the proxy faced severe challenges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By upgrading the entire site to Dubbo3, the business line aims to achieve two goals:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Zhonglun Network Dubbo3 Upgrade Practice</title><link>https://cn.dubbo.apache.org/en/blog/2023/01/15/zhonglun-network-dubbo3-upgrade-practice/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cn.dubbo.apache.org/en/blog/2023/01/15/zhonglun-network-dubbo3-upgrade-practice/</guid><description>&lt;p>Zhonglun Network completed a full upgrade from Dubbo2 to Dubbo3 in 2022, deeply utilizing core capabilities such as application-level service discovery, Kubernetes native service deployment, and service governance. The technical leader from Zhonglun Network, Lai Binbin, provided an in-depth summary of the selection, upgrade process, and benefits of Dubbo3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s worth mentioning that the recent &lt;a href="https://cn.dubbo.apache.org/en/">Dubbo3 official documentation&lt;/a> has undergone significant enhancements, and the community has committed substantial effort to improving the documentation in the near term, which is crucial for the use of Dubbo3 and the enhancement of user confidence.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
